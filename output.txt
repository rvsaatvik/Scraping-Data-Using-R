High MΦ numbers are associated with poor outcome and correlate with tumor cell survival, neovascularization, and metastasis [1]. Tumor cell-derived factors skew MΦ towards a tumor-supporting phenotype in order to facilitate tumor growth and metastatic spread. MΦ exhibit a remarkable heterogeneity [1,2] and functional plasticity that can be described by two extreme phenotypes, known as M1- and M2-polarized MΦ [1,2]. M1-MΦ present the pro-inflammatory or “classically” activated phenotype, whereas M2-MΦ correlate to the anti-inflammatory or “alternatively” activated phenotype. However, these categories largely oversimplify the plasticity of MΦ, which presents a continuum of functional activation states that are determined by the local environment [1]. M1-MΦ mostly emerge during infectious or acute inflammatory conditions and are involved in combating pathogens, promoting the inflammatory response, and activating the adaptive immune response [2]. Anti-inflammatory M2-MΦ are mainly involved in the resolution of inflammation and regeneration [3–5]. Notably, the M2-like MΦ signature is also a characteristic of the tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) phenotype supporting tumor growth.Polarization of MΦ is not only dependent on tumor cell-secreted mediators, but also on the iron content of the tissue. The availability of iron impacts the production and secretion of cytokines, thereby modulating the MΦ phenotype [6, 7]. MΦ are central in regulating iron homeostasis and represent the major source of available iron in the body. In response to inflammation, iron is sequestered in MΦ. This elicits a state of systemic inflammation-associated anemia, whereby the microenvironment is depleted and extracellular pathogen growth is limited [8–10]. In contrast, iron release by MΦ contributes to cell proliferation [11], which is important for tissue repair. In tumor tissue, MΦ are re-programmed to favor the survival of the growing tumor. Therefore, it might be speculated that tumor cells hijack the physiological role of MΦ in iron homeostasis as a source of iron within the tumor to ensure their own survival and growth. Considering the pivotal role of macrophages for iron homeostasis and the fact that the presence of macrophages was associated with histological grade and clinical prognosis in a variety of tumors [12], we sought to investigate the notion that TAMs could be a hitherto unrecognized target of antiproliferative iron chelators.Current research typically focuses on studying the role of iron and iron-chelation therapy in tumor cells, whereas detailed knowledge on the crosstalk between tumor cells and TAMs as a possible source of iron is still lacking. Cancer cells require increased intracellular iron concentration in order to fulfill their enhanced metabolic turnover [13]. Therefore, cancer cells evolved a variety of mechanisms for enhanced uptake and storage of iron. Furthermore, a dysfunction or dysregulation in systemic iron homeostasis is often manifested in cancer patients due to chronic anemia, which is detected in approximately 80% of cancer patients [14]. Moreover, the expression of different iron-regulated genes such as transferrin receptor (TfR) [15], ferritin light (FTL) [16], and the iron regulatory protein (IRP)-2 [17] in tumor cells was correlated with a poor prognosis and a higher tumor grade, leading to increased chemoresistance. The role of iron in cancer progression was also documented by experimental approaches in animal models [18–20]. For instance, mice fed with low-iron diet prior to the implantation of tumor cells significantly delayed tumor growth [21]. Additionally, it was shown by the staining of iron deposits that the tumor outcompetes the natural iron reservoirs in liver and spleen [22]. Importantly, the expression levels of iron gene markers, particularly the iron exporter ferroportin, can be employed as independent predictors of prognosis in breast cancer [23] and might find important applications in individualized tumor therapy.Given the apparent association of iron availability and tumorigenesis, a growing body of evidence anticipates the use of iron chelators as antineoplastic agents. Natural and synthetic iron chelators, such as Desferrioxamine, Deferiprone, and Deferasirox, have been utilized for several decades for the clinical treatment of iron overload due to chronic blood transfusion therapy (typically associated with genetic conditions such as β-thalassemia and sickle-cell anemia) [24]. More recently, iron chelators have been subjected to preclinical and clinical trials in order to evaluate their antineoplastic potential [25]. Despite promising effects of chelation therapy in experimental tumor models, low efficacy or narrow therapeutic windows have been reported in several studies of iron chelating agents in humans. These observations are attributed, at least in part, to the fact that current clinical chelators bind primarily labile plasma iron (also known as non-transferrin-bound iron, NTBI) and are not designed to target intracellular iron in malignant cells. Additionally, it was shown that the high hydrophilicity and unfavorable pharmacokinetic of common iron chelators such as Deferoxamine (DFO) make it difficult to reach an effective intratumoral concentration without unacceptable side effects [26]. The molecular design of new intracellular chelators, as well as prochelation strategies imparting selectivity towards malignant cells, are expected to enhance the scope of iron chelators as antiproliferative agents. Furthermore, a full understanding of the effects of iron chelation on all aspects of tumor growth is critical to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. While most of the current research was focused on tumor cells, the ability to inhibit potential sources of iron within the tumor microenvironment, such as TAMs, has not been explored.Given the central function of MΦ in iron homeostasis and their crucial role during tumor progression, the current study aimed at defining the effects of the intracellular iron chelator (TC3-S)2 on the MΦ phenotype, especially in terms of their iron handling ability and functional effects with respect to cancer cells.Materials and MethodsMaterialsThe disulfide prochelator (TC3-S)2 was synthesized as previously reported [27, 28]. Stock solutions were prepared at a standard concentration of 100 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Solutions were always prepared freshly in degassed DMSO. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.5μg/ml) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), recombinant Interferon (IFN)γ (100U/ml) was obtained from Roche (Indianapolis, US),Interleukin (IL)-10 (20ng/ml) and IL-4 (20 ng/ml) from PeproTech (Hamburg, Germany), DMOG (1 mM) was delivered by Biomol (Hamburg, Germany), and Staurosporine (0.5 μg/ml) came from LC Laboratories (Woburn, USA).Stability of (TC3-S)2 in growth mediumUV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. The aqueous stability of the disulfide prochelator (TC3-S)2 was determined using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy in full Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) growth medium without phenol-red. A stock solution of (TC3-S)2 was prepared in DMSO and diluted in complete growth medium for a final concentration of 12.0μM. The UV-Vis spectra were collected periodically for 24 hours while the temperature was maintained at 37.0°C. Concentrations of (TC3-S)2, at various times were determined using absorbance values at 318 nm relative to that at time zero.Primary macrophage generationHuman monocytes were isolated from commercially available, anonymized buffy coats obtained from a blood bank (DRK-Blutspendedienst Baden-Württemberg-Hessen, Frankfurt, Germany) using Ficoll-Hypaque gradients (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 mM EDTA and subsequently incubated for 1 h at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin to allow their adherence to culture dishes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Non-adherent cells were removed. Monocytes were then differentiated into primary human MΦ with RPMI 1640 containing 5% AB-positive human serum (DRK-Blutspendedienst Baden-Württemberg-Hessen, Frankfurt, Germany) for 7 days and achieved approximately 80% confluence. For 24 h prior to stimulation cells were serum starved. Macrophages were then stimulated for different time periods (8–24 h) in RPMI medium with a combination of 0.5 μg/ml LPS and 100U/ml IFNγ (for M1 polarization) or 20 ng/ml IL-10 (for M2 polarization), alone or in combination with the chelator (100μM, last 6 h). The conditioned media of polarized macrophages were collected, centrifuged at 1000 xg for 5min., and aliquots were stored at -80°C until further use. Conditioned media was used for proliferation measurements in tumor cells. Supernatant of unstimulated macrophages served as control.MCF-7 cell cultureThe human MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was purchased from ATCC-LGC Standard GmbH (Wesel, Germany). MCF-7 cells, were maintained in Dulbecco´s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with high glucose (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany), supplemented with 100U/ml penicillin (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (PAA Laboratories) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; PAA Laboratories). Cells were kept in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C and passaged 3 times per week. For 24 hours prior to stimulation with macrophage-conditioned medium, cells were serum starved.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)MΦ were stimulated either with LPS (0.5 μg/ml/IFNγ (100 U/ml) or IL-10 (20 ng/ml) for 8 h. Where indicated, IL-10 stimulation was supplemented with the chelator (TC3-S)2 at a concentration of 100 μM for the last 4 h of incubation. RNA was extracted using peqGold RNA Pure reagent (Peqlab Biotechnology, Erlangen, Germany). Total RNA (1μg) was transcribed using the Maxima first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the MyiQ real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and Absolute Blue qPCR SYBR green fluorescein mix (Thermo Scientific, Karlsruhe, Germany). Real-time PCR results were quantified using the Bio-Rad CFX Manager (version 3.1) software program from Bio-Rad (Munich, Germany), with 18S mRNA expression as an internal housekeeping gene control for human samples.

After sonification and centrifugation (15.000 xg, 5 min), the protein content was determined by the Lowry method according to manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). 100 μg protein was boiled in loading buffer, supplemented with 20% glycerol and bromphenol blue, loaded on a SDS gel and blotted using Immobilion-FL polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Merck Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in TBST and analyzed using a specific antibody against HIF-1α in a 1:1000 (mouse, polyclonal; BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany, 610959), for PCNA analysis a polyclonal antibody was used at a 1:200 dilution (rabbit, polyclonal, Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany sc-7909). An antibody against nucleolin was used in a 1:3000 (rabbit, polyclonal, Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany sc-13057) as loading control. For quantification, the fluorescence intensity was normalized to tubulin and is given relative to unstimulated controls. PCNA and nucleolin bands were visualized using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-COR Biosciences GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany).For HIF-1α detection, secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, following detection using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL solutions from GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) were used.Flow cytometryMΦ were stimulated either with LPS (0.5 μg/ml/IFNγ (100 U/ml), IL-10 (20 ng/ml) for 8 h in case of FTL and for 24 h for FPN detection. Where indicated, IL-10 stimulation was supplemented with the chelator (TC3-S)2 at a concentration of 100 μM for the last 4 h of incubation. MΦ were detached using Accutase (PAA) at 37°C and were transferred to FACS tubes for further treatment. To discriminate viable cells from apoptotic and necrotic cells, samples were stained with annexin V/propidium iodide (Annexin antibody and PI were purchased from Immunotools, Friesoythe, Germany), measured on a LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany), and analyzed using the FACS Diva system (BD Bioscience, San Jose, USA). As a positive control, cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/mL staurosporine (Sts; Sigma) for 4 hours at 37°C. FPN and FTL expression were analyzed using specific antibodies to recognize FPN (rabbit, polyclonal, Novus, Littleton, USA, NBP1-21502) and FTL (rabbit, monoclonal, abcam, Cambridge, UK, Ab109373) in a 1:100 dilution. Samples were measured and analyzed as described above. Polarization markers CD86 (mouse, monoclonal, BD Biosciences, clone 2331 (FUN-1), 555657), CD206 (mouse, monoclonal, BioLegend, San Diego, USA, clone 15–2, 321108), CD80 (mouse, monoclonal, BioLegend, clone 2D10, 305220), and CD163 (mouse, monoclonal, BD Bioscience, clone GHI/61, 556018) were measured and analyzed as described above.Proliferation assayProliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells was measured using the RTCA DP xCELLigence instrument (OLS, Bremen, Germany). Initially, a background measurement of the detector containing an E-plate insert was performed using 50 μl serum-free media incubated for 30 min in the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2). In parallel, human MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with trypsin, quantified, and added to the insert in 100 μl serum-free media (40.000 cells per well). MΦ-conditioned media were added. Proliferation was measured as an increase in impedance continuously for a period of 99 h. Data are presented as the slope per hour of the normalized cell index as a measure for the time-dependent changes in impedance. The RTCA Software 1.2 (OLS, Bremen, Germany) was used for both data acquisition and analysis. For the determination of the proliferation markers PCNA and Ki-67, MCF-7 cells were treated for 24 h with MΦ-conditioned media and measured by qRT-PCR as described above.Adhesion assayMCF-7 cells were stimulated with MΦ-conditioned media for 2 days and labelled with cell tracker green (Life Technologies). 5 x 104 MCF-7 cells were seeded on collagen I (10 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) or fibronectin (10 μg/ml; Sigma Aldrich) pre-coated wells for 2 h, washed, and fixed with 4% PFA. 5 pictures were taken from each group from at least three independent experiments using triplicates and the number of attached cells was quantified.MigrationMigration of MCF-7 breast cancer cells was measured using the RTCA DP xCELLigence instrument. Initially, the bottom of the upper chamber was pre-coated with collagen I (10 μg/ml; BD Biosciences). Afterwards, a background measurement of the detector containing a two-chamber CIM-plate insert was performed using 30 μl serum-free media incubated for 30 min in the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2). In parallel, human MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with trypsin, quantified, and added to the upper chamber in 100 μl MΦ-conditioned media (40.000 cells per well). After 30 min incubation at RT, migration was measured as the increase in impedance continuously for a period of 4 h. Data are presented as the slope as a measure for the time-dependent changes in impedance. The RTCA Software 1.2 was used for both data acquisition and analysis.Atomic absorption spectrometryMΦ were stimulated either with LPS (0.5 μg/ml/IFNγ (100 U/ml) or IL-10 (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. Where indicated, IL-10 stimulation was supplemented with the chelators (TC3-S)2 at a concentration of 100 μM for the last 4 h of incubation. The iron content of MΦ supernatants was determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Samples were measured as triplicates with a PinAAcle™ 900 T Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, USA). Slit 0.2 nm and wavelength 248,33 nm were used as spectrometer parameters. A hollow cathode iron lamp (30 mA maximum operating current) was run at 100% maximum current. The calibration solutions (10 μg/l to 90 μg/l) were prepared by adequate dilution of Iron Standard for AAS (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) stock solution. A pyrolysis temperature of 1400°C and an atomization temperature of 2100°C were used.Statistical analysisEach experiment was performed at least three times. The p values were calculated using One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc test considered to be significant at *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.ResultsPolarization dictates the macrophage iron phenotypeIn order to test the functionality of intracellular iron chelation on macrophage iron polarization, we first established an experimental cell culture set-up that allows us to modify the macrophage iron phenotype. Considering previous findings from Recalcati et al. [11], primary human MΦ were either stimulated with a combination of LPS/IFNγ in order to induce a classically activated M1-phenotype or polarized towards M2 using IL-10. The purity of the M2 culture was confirmed by analyzing polarization markers at protein (S1A Fig) and mRNA level (S1B Fig), observing a significant up-regulation of anti-inflammatory markers and a decrease of pro-inflammatory mediators. We then analyzed the iron-regulated gene profile at mRNA level by qRT-PCR measurements (Fig 1A) and at protein level by flow cytometry (Fig 1B and 1C). The iron exporter FPN is decreased in LPS/IFNγ-treated MΦ, both at mRNA and protein level. In contrast, M2-polarization upon IL-10 stimulation significantly up-regulates FPN mRNA and protein levels. In line with these findings, we observed a significant up-regulation of its natural ligand HAMP by stimulation with LPS/IFNγ and a significant IL-10-induced decrease. Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of IRP2 and TfR. Both genes remained unaffected by LPS/IFNγ-stimulation, but were significantly induced upon IL-10-stimulation. Moreover, Ceruloplasmin (CP), a protein endowed with ferroxidase activity, was significantly induced by LPS/IFNγ and showed a decreased expression after IL-10-treatment. The iron storage protein FTL showed a significantly increased mRNA expression upon LPS/IFNγ treatment, which was confirmed at protein level. On the contrary, FTL was down-regulated in IL-10-stimulated MΦ, both at mRNA and protein level. The results obtained for the iron-release phenotype could be reproduced and confirmed by polarization of primary human macrophages with IL-4 (S2 Fig), which was in line with previous work [6].

(D) Iron content in macrophage supernatants was quantified by AAS measurement. (E) MCF-7 breast cancer cells were stimulated with macrophage conditioned media (CM) and proliferation was analyzed by qRT-PCR of (E) PCNA, Ki-67, (F) Western analysis of PCNA, and (G) xCELLigence. Data are means ± S.D.M, n>6, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 vs. control/CM_control.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166164.g001As a functional readout, we quantified the iron content in MΦ supernatants (CM) by atomic-absorption-spectrometry (AAS) (Fig 1D). Analysis of the iron content showed a significant increase of iron in the supernatant of IL-10-stimulated M2-polarizedMΦ, whereas a substantial decrease was observed for LPS/IFNγ treated M1-MΦ compared to unstimulated control.In order to define the functional consequences of MΦ-polarization in terms of iron sequestration versus release, we checked the proliferation rate of tumor cells, which were stimulated with supernatants of LPS/IFNγ- or IL-10-treated MΦ (Fig 1E and 1F). We determined mRNA expression of the two known proliferation markers proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Fig 1E) and Ki-67(Fig 1E) [29, 30] as well as PCNA protein expression (Fig 1F), and analyzed proliferation in real-time using the xCELLigence system (Fig 1G). In line with our previous results regarding macrophage iron polarization, we observed a significantly reduced tumor cell proliferation upon incubation of tumor cells with LPS/IFNγ-stimulated MΦ supernatants. However, stimulation of tumor cells with IL-10-treated MΦ supernatants significantly enhanced MCF-7 proliferation. The supplementation of growth medium with FeCl3 served as positive control [31].Taken together, our results indicated that alternatively activated MΦ (IL-10 treatment) show an iron-release phenotype and stimulate tumor cell survival and proliferation, whereas classically activated MΦ (LPS/IFNγ) induce an iron-sequestration phenotype with functional consequences on inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, which is in line with previous reports [6, 32]. As such, we sought to investigate the effect of iron scavengers on the polarization and corresponding phenotype of macrophages, which could therefore impact overall tumor growth.Effects of iron chelation in macrophagesWe analyzed the activity of a recently developed chelation system in primary human MΦ. Prochelator (TC3-S)2 (Fig 2A), which features a disulfide linkage between two thiosemicarbazone units, lacks sufficient donor ability and appropriate geometry for iron coordination in aqueous solutions (including growth media). This construct is in turn activated upon cell entry through reduction and disulfide cleavage by intracellular reductants (e.g., glutathione) liberating thiol TC3-SH, which promptly coordinates iron with a high-affinity tridentate binding unit [27, 28]. Particularly relevant to the present study, prochelator (TC3-S)2 remains intact in complete growth media and therefore does not interfere with extracellular iron levels (Fig 2B).

Prochelation approach and stability in cell culture medium.(A) Scheme of the redox directed chelation system: The disulfide-based prochelator (TC3-S)2 undergoes intracellular reduction to produce the active chelator TC3-SH, which readily binds iron forming a stable complex. (B) Stability of prochelator (TC3-S)2 at 12.0 μM in phenol red-free EMEM: relative concentrations over the course of 24 hours were determined by UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy (λmax = 318 nm, 37°C). No measureable loss of the prochelator is observed over the course of 2 hours, and less than 10% loss is observed over 24 hours.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166164.g002As a molecular target to test functionality of the chelators, we chose hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Because HIF-1α is marked for degradation by iron-dependent prolyl hydroxylases (PHD), iron deprivation results in deactivation of PHD and HIF-1α accumulation [33]. As a positive control, we used the PHD inhibitor dimethyloxalyl glycine (DMOG), which leads to an oxygen-independent and long-lasting activation of HIF-1α [34]. We incubated MΦ in the presence of (TC3-S)2 for 4 h, 8 h, and 24 h and measured the accumulation of HIF-1α by Western analysis (Fig 3A). Our results show a significant induction of HIF-1α protein already after 4 h of chelator treatment. (TC3-S)2 peaked at a time-point of 8 h and decreased its activity after 24 h, where only a slight induction could be observed. These experiments were critical to establish the timeframe of the subsequent experiments to study macrophage phenotype in the presence of the chelator and we decided to incubate the chelator for 4 h in further experiments. In addition, we performed Annexin V/PI stainings in order to rule out cytotoxic effects of the used chelator in our setting (Fig 3B). As a positive control, we used staurosporine. Results showed that the chelator used in this study did not compromise MΦ viability, which is of critical importance for further experiments using the chelator in combination with polarization treatments.

We incubated MΦ with the chelator for 4 h under unstimulated conditions to define the basal effect on the MΦ phenotype. In order to check the ability to modulate the MΦ iron-release phenotype, we pre-stimulated macrophages for 4 h with IL-10 in order to induce the previously observed iron-release phenotype and treated them for additional 4 h in combination with the chelator for mRNA analysis using qRT-PCR. For protein detection, MΦ were pre-stimulated with IL-10 for 20 h and additional 4 h with experimental chelator. Again, an iron-regulated gene profile was analyzed at mRNA (Fig 4A) and protein level (Fig 4B). No difference was observed in the expression of the iron exporter FPN under basal conditions. However, chelation treatment of IL-10-pre-stimulated MΦ significantly decreased FPN expression. Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of IRP2 and TfR upon chelator treatment. Under basal conditions, both genes were downregulated. However, the IL-10-induced upregulation of both IRP2 and TfR could be reversed by chelator co-treatment. Moreover, we measured the FPN ligand HAMP and the ferroxidase CP, which were both downregulated under basal conditions. HAMP was reduced after IL-10 treatment, but significantly enhanced upon (TC3-S)2 co-treatment, whereas CP remained unaffected in IL-10-pre-treated MΦ. The iron storage protein FTL showed no difference under basal conditions, whereas chelation treatment of IL-10-pre-stimulated MΦ significantly enhanced FTL mRNA expression, which was also corroborated at protein level. Again, these results could be confirmed using IL-4 as another M2-stimulus (S2A Fig).

We observed no basal effect of chelator treatment in MΦ supernatants compared to the control. However, the significant IL-10-induced increase of iron concentration in the supernatant was reversed upon co-treatment with chelator.Functional consequences of chelator-dependent reprogramming of the macrophage iron phenotype in breast cancer cellsSince the iron-release phenotype observed after IL-10-stimulation could be blocked by chelator co-treatment, we aimed at determining the functional consequences of the MΦ iron phenotype modulation using the proliferation setting introduced above. To this end, we incubated human MCF-7 breast cancer cells with the supernatant of macrophages treated with either (TC3-S)2 alone or in combination with IL-10. The quantification of PCNA (Fig 5A) and Ki-67 mRNA expression (Fig 5B) as well as real-time measurement of cellular proliferation using xCELLigence (Fig 5C) corroborated our previous findings. Incubation of MCF-7 cells with supernatants of MΦ previously treated with chelators did not have any effect on cellular proliferation, whereas supernatant of IL-10-stimulated MΦ significantly enhanced tumor cell proliferation. However, supernatants of IL-10/chelator-treated MΦ significantly reduced the proliferation outcome as compared to IL-10 alone. This observation is consistent with those reported by Recalcati et al. in a different experimental setup employing the cell-impermeant chelator HM-DFO to study the effect of macrophage-conditioned media on cancer cell proliferation [6].

Since migration through the ECM is considered critical during early steps of the metastatic cascade, we examined the effect of macrophage-secreted iron on tumor cell migration using the xCELLigence system (Fig 5D). We observed that conditioned media from M2-polarized, iron-release MΦ (IL-10-treatment) significantly enhanced MCF-7 cancer cell migration, whereas the treatment of tumor cells with supernatants of MΦ previously co-treated with IL-10 and chelator reversed this effect. Moreover, the attachment of tumor cells to extracellular matrix (ECM) components of the lung, including collagen I and fibronectin, is an essential step for tumor cell dissemination. We observed that MΦ-secreted iron after IL-10 treatment significantly enhanced adhesion to both matrices (Fig 5E), whereas prior treatment of MΦ with the chelator significantly blocked this effect.Taken collectively, our results indicate that treatment with (TC3-S)2 is able to reverse the IL-10-induced MΦ iron-release phenotype with functional consequences on cellular iron content, tumor cell proliferation and metastatic behavior.DiscussionCancer cells evolved specialized mechanisms for iron acquisition, storage, and transport in order to ensure their enhanced metabolic turnover. Therefore, tumor-evocated iron handling has emerged as an important aspect of tumor progression. In comparison to healthy cells, cancer cells show enhanced iron sequestration, which results in the development of more aggressive tumors [35–37]. A growing number of studies were conducted to explore the role of iron-related proteins in the context of cancer [6, 7, 38]. The reduced expression of the iron exporter FPN in tumor cells was correlated to the aggressiveness of breast cancer subtypes [23]. High tumor cell FPN levels were correlated to other well-established prognostic markers for better patient survival and outcome, such as the absence of estrogen receptor, low histological grade, and low spread of disease to the lymph nodes. In node-negative breast cancer patients, FTL stored in TAMs was validated as a prognostic biomarker [39]. Because of the growing evidence on their tumor-promoting effects, the expression of iron-regulated genes could become an important factor among the prognostic markers of tumorigenesis.The role of iron-regulated genes was mainly studied in tumor cells: numerous studies have examined methods to interfere with iron handling in cancer cells, either by directly modulating iron-regulated genes or by the use of iron chelators. Iron chelating agents inhibit DNA synthesis and typically cause a G1-S-phase cell cycle arrest [40], attenuate epithelial-mesenchymal-transition [41], correct the disturbed epigenetic signature of malignant tumor cells [19], and promote cancer cell apoptosis. Nevertheless, a detailed knowledge of the effects on chelators within the tumor microenvironment (and on potential iron sources thereof) is still lacking.Due to their important role in tumor development and iron handling, we proposed that MΦ might adopt a pro-tumorigenic iron-release phenotype, whereby tumor growth is favored [42]. MΦ are one of the major populations of functionally polarized immune cells in tumors, and their abundance is often associated with a poor patient prognosis [43, 44]. This observation is mainly correlated to their potential to support tumor development at various stages by producing growth and survival factors, by recruiting blood vessels to the tumor (angiogenesis), and supporting metastasis by promoting tumor cell invasion, migration, and intravasation [45]. Intriguingly, because they are central players in systemic iron homeostasis, MΦ have evolved unique mechanisms to recycle, store, and release iron to their local microenvironment. MΦ iron homeostasis is therefore coupled to their functional heterogeneity and plasticity, and the MΦ polarization process dictates expression profiles of genes involved in iron metabolism.We and others [6, 46] observed that the treatment of MΦ with LPS/IFNγ enhanced the sequestration of iron within the cell, whereas stimulation with anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 or IL4/IL-13 induced the release of iron from MΦ. This goes in line with a typical cytokine/chemokine profile of M1- and M2-MΦ. However, it is still not exactly defined if the MΦ polarization process dictates intracellular iron handling, or rather if iron availability determines the MΦ phenotype. So far, it is known that pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 induce the expression of iron-dependent genes in MΦ [47], resulting in iron retention. Moreover, it was also shown that the amount of intracellular iron regulates cytokine formation and polarization of macrophages [48, 49]. Apparently, the control of iron availability is a central step during innate immune responses and thus MΦ are positioned at the interface of immunity and iron homeostasis. In this context, the MΦ iron signature emerges as an additional component of a more complex polarization process to adapt the MΦ phenotype to adverse environments, such as chronic inflammatory disease states, i.e. within tumors.The presence of immune cells, in particular MΦ, and inflammatory mediators in tumor tissue is a hallmark of chronic inflammation and closely linked to the outcome regarding tumor progression. Therefore, it might be speculated that iron sequestration in MΦ depletes the microenvironment, thereby fostering inflammation and leading to tumor suppression. In contrast, iron release from MΦ would contribute to bystander cell proliferation and survival, which is important for tumor progression [42]. This is particularly relevant since it was appreciated that tumor cells are not able to acquire a fully invasive potential without the recruitment and the support of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, especially MΦ [50–52]. Along this line, recent studies could show that lymphocytes and MΦ synthesize and secrete ferritin which, in turn, stimulates tumor cell proliferation in an iron-dependent manner [39, 53–55]. These data reinforce the importance of the tumor microenvironment in terms of the iron-handling capacity of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, in particular MΦ. Considering that MΦ constitute a major fraction of the infiltrates in most solid tumors and their pivotal role in iron metabolism, the implication of TAMs in iron distribution within the tumor microenvironment and their response to iron chelators represent important areas of investigation in contemporary cancer biology.In order to assess the impact of iron sequestration on MΦ function, we employed the disulfide-based prochelator (TC3-S)2, which is converted to thiol chelator TC3-SH upon intracellular reduction. The prochelator scaffold, namely the species added to growth media in the present studies in cultured cells, is not suitable for iron coordination and therefore this chelation system targets intracellular iron and does not alter iron availability in the extracellular space. As such, this prochelation strategy is particularly advantageous for the study of iron with respect to the crosstalk between TAMs and cancer cells. In accordance to this hypothesis, the current study provides, for the first time, data on the functionality of intracellular prochelators on re-programing the macrophage phenotype from iron release towards iron sequestration with its functional consequences on breast cancer cells. In line with our study on the use of iron chelators in macrophages, Corna et al. previously reported the use of DFO in M2-like bone marrow-derived macrophages [46]. In contrast to our results, they observed an enhanced expression of TfR, whereas we detected a significant decrease in TfR in chelator-treated M2-like primary human macrophage. However, FPN expression was reduced in both experimental settings. These distinct results could be attributed to differences between the mouse and the human system, and/or might be stimulus-dependent (IL-4 vs. IL-10 stimulation). An additional explanation for the observed discrepancy on TfR expression could be the specificity of prochelator system (TC3-S)2, which acts exclusively within cells, whereas DFO is also active extracellularly. Furthermore, the different incubation times for the chelators (overnight vs. 4 h in our case) could capture different phases of the cellular response to iron deprivation. Collectively, our findings indicate that disulfide-based prochelators could affect cancer cell proliferation both directly [28] and through the emerging tumor-promoting programs of iron handling by macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, we observed that macrophage-secreted iron promotes not only tumor cell growth, but also enhanced the metastatic behavior of cancer cells. In contrast, stimulation of breast cancer cells with supernatants from chelator-treated, re-programmed iron sequestration macrophages significantly blocked this effect. Moreover, previous studies using DFO underscore the importance of macrophage-released iron for tumor cell proliferation and T cell activation [56].Summarizing, our results support the notion that macrophages and their iron-release phenotype favor tumor progression and metastasis. Future in vivo studies should address the possibility to interfere with tumor development by using macrophage-targeted chelation strategies. Moreover, further investigation is needed to define at a molecular level how cancer cells actually manage to acquire iron from their microenvironment and how they manipulate macrophages to serve them as an additional iron source in order to maintain their enhanced metabolism and growth.Supporting InformationS1 Fig. Polarization profile of IL-10-treated macrophages.(A) Surface expression of polarization markers CD86, CD206, and CD80, measured by FACS analysis.

Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are standard clinical tumor markers for determining the appropriate therapy for breast cancer patients [1]. The absence of ER and PR, and the lack of HER2 over-expression have consistently been associated with a poorer prognosis [2]. Inflammatory cytokines are also associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival in patients with breast cancer [3–5]. Cytokines are low molecular weight pleiotropic glycoproteins that play key roles in breast cancer development and progression [6–8]. The role of cytokines in modulating tumor microenvironments has been well studied [9–10], particularly in breast cancer [11,12]. Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-11, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) are involved in the stimulation of cancer cell proliferation and invasion [11,13]. Additionally, NF-κB-dependent intracellular signaling and activation of cytokine receptors can accelerate tumor progression [10]. IL molecules play important roles in tumor microenvironments and in activating tumor growth and progression. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of IL genes in breast cancer have not been widely studied.Here, we observed that IL-20 is the sole cytokine over-expressed in ER-positive MCF-7 cells upon estradiol (E2) treatment. IL-20 was not overexpressed in ER-negative breast cancer cell lines. Analysis of RNA and protein expression also showed overexpression of IL-20 in ER-positive breast cancer tissues. Induction of IL-20 expression in E2-treated MCF-7 cells was mediated by epigenetic regulation through the KMT2B histone methyltransferase, but not by other members of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) family of histone methyltransferases.The MLL gene family is often involved in chromosome translocations in human acute leukemia, causing the fusion of the normal MLL gene family member with one of over 60 genes on other chromosomes [14,15,16]. Genes of the MLL family (MLL/KMT2A, MLL2/KMT2D, MLL3/KMT2C, MLL4/KMT2B, and MLL5/KMT2E) encode an evolutionarily conserved family of histone methyltransferases (HMTs). MLL family members regulate the activation of gene expression, including the clustered HOX homeobox genes, through methylation of the lysine 4 residue of histone H3 (H3K4) [17–20]. Many MLL genes have been described to be involved in different types of cancer, including breast cancers [21–23]. However, the histone methyltransferases responsible for H3K4 methylation of mammalian gene enhancers and promoters remain elusive. The way that HMTs work independently, or cooperatively, with specific transcription factors to epigenetically regulate cell-type-specific gene expression remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we show that KMT2B interacts with ERα to bind the ERα-binding sites of IL-20 and other ERα target genes with H3K4 modifications. Additionally, depletion of KMT2B or IL-20 led to the inhibition of E2-dependent cell proliferation, loss of colony formation and cell arrest.ResultsIL-20 is induced by estradiol treatment in MCF-7 cells and is strongly associated with ER-positive breast cancerWe performed genome-wide expression profiling to investigate whether the expression of interleukin (IL) genes was under E2-dependent transcriptional regulation. We used microarray analysis to identify IL gene expression in ER-positive MCF-7 cells with or without E2 induction. Of the 39 IL genes, only IL-20 was over-expressed in E2-treated MCF-7 cells (Fig 1A). RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that IL-20 gene expression was significantly induced in E2-treated MCF-7 cells, and was not affected by E2 in the ER-negative cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A (Fig 1B). Indeed, ELISA analysis also showed that the amount protein of IL-20 secretion was dramatically induced in E2-stimulated MCF-7 cells (S1 Fig).

(E) IHC analyses of IL-20 protein expression in human breast carcinomas in tissue microarrays (TMAs). The staining results show that ER-positive breast cancer expresses significantly more IL-20 than ER-negative breast cancer, and cancer adjacent normal tissues. Hematoxylin was used as counterstain. Representative images of normal adjacent breast tissue (1), ER-negative malignant breast tissue (2), and ER-positive malignant breast tissue (3) are shown.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166090.g001We examined IL-20 mRNA levels across a panel of breast cancer subtypes and normal breast tissues. IL-20 mRNA levels were significantly elevated in ER-positive breast cancer compared to that in normal breast, triple-negative, and ER-negative breast cancers (Fig 1C). We also showed that IL-20 was significantly over-expressed in ER-positive breast cancer by using the Gluck and TCGA Breast gene expression datasets available in Oncomine (https://www.oncomine.org/) (Fig 1D).We further evaluated IL-20 protein levels in an independent tissue microarray panel containing 47 ER-positive breast carcinoma samples, 97 ER-negative breast carcinoma samples, and 6 ER-negative cancer-adjacent normal breast tissue samples. Analysis by immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that IL-20 was abundantly expressed in 80.9% of ER-positive breast cancer samples (P < 0.001). Furthermore, IL-20 expression was observed in only 15.4% of ER-negative breast cancer samples (P < 0.001) and in none of the adjacent normal breast tissue samples (Fig 1E). These results indicate that over-expression of IL-20 mRNA and protein is associated with breast cancer, and particularly with the ER-positive subtype.ERα is required for the induction of IL-20 gene expressionIL-20 was significantly over-expressed in ER-positive cancer cells and tissues, possibly through estrogen signaling mediated by the ERα estrogen receptor, encoded by ESR1. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of ESR1-specific siRNA, or of the ERα antagonist ICI 182,780 (ICI), on the expression of IL-20 mRNA MCF-7 cells. ESR1-siRNA treatment efficiently depleted ERα with or without E2 treatment (Fig 2A). Depletion of ERα by ESR1-siRNA significantly reduced E2-dependent activation of IL-20 expression (Fig 2B and S2 Fig). Activation of IL-20 expression was also inhibited by ICI treatment (Fig 2B). Additionally, ELISA analysis confirmed that E2-dependent induction of IL-20 secretion was significantly decreased in MCF-7 cells transfected with ESR1-siRNAs (S1 Fig).

The experiment was carried out in the presence or absence of E2 for 30 min.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166090.g002Transcriptional regulation of IL-20 by ERα, following E2-dependent activation, was investigated using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP assays were performed 0 and 30 min after E2-treatment in MCF-7 cells. We divided the IL-20 gene body and its flanking sequences into six regions. ChIP experiments were performed to analyze ERα occupancy in these regions with or without E2 treatment. Robust binding of ERα was observed at the promoter region of IL-20 in E2-treated cells (Fig 2C).The specific binding of ERα to the IL-20 promoter following E2 treatment was abolished in the presence of the ERα antagonist, ICI (Fig 2D). Furthermore, over-expression of a truncated ERα, lacking the DNA-binding domain (ERα264–595) [24], decreased the induction of IL-20 expression in E2-induced MCF-7 cells (Fig 2B). As expected, both over-expression of ERα264–595 and treatment with ICI inhibited the recruitment of RNA Pol II to IL-20 chromatin (Fig 2E). These data demonstrate that ERα directly associates with the promoter region of IL-20 to up-regulate IL-20 gene expression in the presence of E2.Transcriptional induction of IL-20 by estradiol is dependent on the estrogen response element (ERE)-like sequence in the IL-20 promoterWe performed motif scanning to examine the ERα binding site of the IL-20 promoter. We revealed a sequence element within segment 2 of the IL-20 promoter region (5′-ATGCCAAACAGAGCT-3′) closely related to the estrogen response element (ERE) (5′-AGGTCACGGTGACCT-3′). To examine whether DNA containing this sequence is responsible for E2-mediated transcriptional regulation, we cloned a Bgl II—Nco I (-1211 to +180 nucleotides) human IL-20 promoter fragment and transiently transfected it into MCF-7 cells. The ability of the Bgl II—Nco I IL-20 promoter fragment to regulate transcription was assessed using a luciferase reporter assay. Compared with controls, treatment with E2 caused a 10.1-fold increase in luciferase activity (S3A Fig). As expected, co-treatment with E2 and ICI abolished E2-induced ERE-driven activity (S3A Fig). In addition, luciferase activity was clearly inhibited when ERα expression was depleted by the ESR1-specific siRNA following E2 treatment (S3A Fig).To further define the sequence element responsible for the E2 response, we transfected MCF-7 cells with clones containing two shorter DNA fragments from the IL-20 promoter region (-822 to +180 or -499 to +180). Cells transfected with the longer construct (-822 to +180) exhibited a 9.7-fold increase in luciferase activity following E2 treatment, similar to that of the full length construct (S3B Fig). However, cells transfected with the shorter construct (-499 to +180) did not respond to E2 stimulation (S3B Fig). This indicates that the functional ERE-like element is located between -822 and -499 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site. This is consistent with our ChIP results indicating ERα occupancy at segment 2 of the IL-20 gene (Fig 2C), and with the location of the ERE-like sequence identified in motif scanning. Furthermore, mutation of the ERE-like element abolished the E2-induced up-regulation of luciferase activity (S3C Fig).We also performed an in vitro oligonucleotide pull-down assay using total protein extract from proliferating MCF-7 cells. We labeled double stranded DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the perfect ERE, the IL-20 ERE-like, and mutated IL-20 ERE-like with biotin. Streptavidin was used to immunoprecipitate proteins associated with each biotin-labeled DNA segment and the immunoprecipitated proteins were examined by western blotting using an anti-ERα antibody. We found that ERα was associated with the perfect ERE and IL-20 ERE-like sequences, but not with the mutated IL-20 ERE-like sequence (S3D Fig). These data confirm that ERα binds specifically to the identified ERE-like element in the IL-20 promoter.KMT2B regulates E2-induced IL-20 over-expression through H3K4 modificationWe performed ChIP assays using anti-H3K4me1, anti-H3K4me2, and anti-H3K4me3 to determine the nature of histone modifications involved in the epigenetic regulation of IL-20 expression. Activation mark H3K4me1 was rapidly enriched at the ERα-binding site of IL-20 30 min after E2 treatment, whereas there were no significant changes in the levels of H3K4me2 and H3k4me3 (Fig 3A). Furthermore, after 30 min of E2-treatment the level of H3K4me1 declined, and the level of H3K4me3 increased (S4 Fig), suggesting sequential methylation of H3K4.

The antibodies used are shown in the right panel.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166090.g003MLL family members specifically methylate H3K4. Therefore, we examined whether other MLL members were involved in E2-induced IL-20 gene expression through modification of H3K4 methylation. We used specific siRNAs to separately knockdown the levels of KMT2A (MLL1), KMT2B (MLL4), KMT2C (MLL3), KMT2D (MLL2), and KMT2E (MLL5) following treatment with E2. Depletion of KMT2B significantly suppressed E2-induced expression of IL-20 (Fig 3B and S2C Fig). siRNA mediated depletion of the other MLL family members investigated (KMT2A, KMT2C, KMT2D, and KMT2E) did not affect E2-induced IL-20 expression (Fig 3B). The specificity of siRNA-mediated knockdown was confirmed by RT-qPCR (S5 Fig). Indeed, ELISA analysis also showed that E2-dependent induction of IL-20 secretion was significantly decreased in MCF-7 cells transfected with KMT2B-siRNAs (S1 Fig).Next, we used ChIP to examine whether KMT2B was recruited to IL-20 chromatin after E2 treatment. KMT2B was recruited to the ERα binding site of IL-20 after E2 treatment (Fig 3C). Furthermore, depletion of KMT2B diminished the level of H3K4me1 at the IL-20 ERα binding site after E2 treatment (Fig 3D). Western blotting and immunostaining showed that depletion of KMT2B significantly reduced global H3K4me1 levels following E2 treatment (Fig 3E and S6 Fig). These findings suggest that KMT2B is recruited to the ERα binding region of the IL-20 promoter for H3K4 methylation and is required for E2-mediated activation of IL-20.KMT2B and ERα are interdependently co-localized at the IL-20 promoterSince KMT2B was recruited to the ERα binding site of IL-20 promoter, we examined whether the recruitment of KMT2B to the ERα binding site was ERα-dependent. Depletion of ERα, or ICI treatment, abolished KMT2B recruitment to IL-20 chromatin in E2-treated cells (Fig 4A). Additionally, depletion of ERα, or ICI treatment, decreased the level of H3K4me1 in E2-treated cells (Fig 4B). Conversely, in E2-treated cells depletion of KMT2B abolished recruitment of ERα and RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) to IL-20 chromatin (Fig 4C and 4D). These data suggest that ERα and KMT2B are interdependently associated with IL-20 chromatin.

KMT2B and ERα were rapidly recruited to the IL-20 promoter region and kinetic ChIP analysis showed coordinated binding of KMT2B and ERα to the promoter after E2 induction (Fig 5A).

(E) KMT2B and IL-20 protein expression in ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer assayed by IHC.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166090.g005To determine whether KMT2B and ERα are recruited to the IL-20 promoter as a complex we performed ChIP-ReChIP experiments after 30 min of E2 treatment. KMT2B and ERα were found to be present together at the IL-20 promoter in an E2-dependent manner (Fig 5B). Additionally, H3K4me1 was found co-localized with either KMT2B or ERα at the IL-20 promoter in an E2-dependent manner (Fig 5B). These findings suggest that the KMT2B and ERα form a protein complex at the IL-20 promoter to regulate IL-20 expression. Physical interaction between KMT2B and ERα was verified by co-immunoprecipitation in E2-induced MCF-7 cells (Fig 5C). Furthermore, using a FLAG-tagged in vitro pull-down assay, we showed that KMT2B directly interacts with an ERα fragment containing the activation function 1 (AF1) domain (Fig 5D).Following E2 treatment, KMT2B interacts with ERα to regulate IL-20 expression. Therefore, we assessed KMT2B expression according to the ER status of clinical tissue samples. To confirm the role of KMT2B in breast cancer, we performed IHC on tissue microarrays to observe the in situ expression of the KMT2B protein. KMT2B expression was significantly associated with ERα-positive breast cancer (70.2%; P < 0.001, Fig 5E). Of the 53 KMT2B-positive samples, 33 were ERα-positive. Furthermore, of the 33 KMT2B-positive / ERα-positive samples, 29 were positive for IL-20 (87%; P < 0.001, Fig 5E). These data suggest that KMT2B and ERα synergistically regulate IL-20 in breast cancer.ERα and KMT2B-mediated induction of IL-20 expression is required for E2-stimulated cell proliferationHere, we have shown that the E2-mediated induction of IL-20 expression is regulated by KMT2B and ERα. E2 also binds to ERα to induce cell proliferation. Therefore, we examined whether KMT2B or IL-20 were involved in the E2-dependent proliferation of MCF-7 cells. KMT2B or IL-20 knockdown inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 cells (Fig 6A). Furthermore, in colony formation assays, depletion of either KMT2B or IL-20 significantly inhibited colony formation, as seen by the reduced number and size of MCF-7 colonies (Fig 6B). We further examined the effect of KMT2B or IL-20 knockdown on E2-induced cell proliferation using flow cytometry. Depletion of KMT2B or IL-20 in E2-treated MCF-7 cells resulted in M-phase cell cycle arrest (Fig 6C). These data suggest that the induction of IL-20 by KMT2B is required for E2-induced proliferation in ERα-positive cells.

Of the 369 genes up-regulated by E2 treatment, 195 (52.8%) were down-regulated upon KMT2B depletion (S7A Fig). We used RT-qPCR to confirm the microarray results for five ERα target genes: PGR, BCL2, GREB1, SIAH2, and TFF1. E2-dependent induction of PGR, BCL2, GREB1, SIAH2I, and TFF1 was significantly suppressed in KMT2B-depleted cells (S7B Fig).We next analyzed the mechanism by which KMT2B regulates ERα target genes. First, we performed ChIP assays using an anti-ERα antibody to confirm E2-dependent ERα recruitment to the promoters of BCL2, GREB1, and TFF1 in MCF-7 cells. In E2-induced cells, ERα was bound to the ERα binding sites of the BCL2 enhancer, and the GREB1 and TFF1 promoters (S7C Fig). Additionally, ChIP using an anti-KMT2B antibody revealed that KMT2B was bound to the same regulatory regions of these genes (S7D Fig). E2-dependent ERα binding was abolished when KMT2B was depleted, and vice versa. In the presence of E2, the ERα binding sites were highly enriched with H3K4me1, but became depleted when ERα or KMT2B were knocked-down (S7E Fig). KMT2B and ERα are both required for the E2-induced deposition of active H3K4me1 mark and activation of ERα target genes. Therefore, the cis-regulatory elements of BCL2, GREB1, and TFF are able to recruit both KMT2B and ERα. Finally, KMT2B and ERα are also required for the recruitment of RNA Pol II to gene promoters in E2-treated MCF-7 cells (S7F Fig). These data demonstrate that ERα co-operates with KMT2B to epigenetically and transcriptionally regulate the E2-mediated induction of ERα target genes.DiscussionBreast cancer is the most common type of cancer in woman. The initiation and progression of breast cancer has been under intensive investigation. Inflammation has emerged as a mediator of pro-tumorigenic processes and tumorigenesis. The secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors by infiltrating immune cells and activated fibroblasts results in an inflammatory environment that can contribute to cancer development [25–27]. Recently, several cytokines have been identified as regulators involved in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment [10, 28–30]. Here, we showed that cytokine IL-20 is an ERα target associated with ER-positive breast cancer. IL-20 family cytokines facilitate communication between epithelial and leukocytes [31] and IL-20 is involved in psoriasis, stroke and rheumatoid arthritis.Recently IL-20 has been shown to have roles in breast and colon cancers [8,30]. Hsu et al. found that IL-20 expression was associated with advanced breast cancer and that an IL-20 monoclonal antibody could suppress tumor progression and bone metastasis in a mouse model [30]. Here, we found that IL-20 is more specifically associated with ER-positive breast cancer and is regulated by estrogen. Given that Hsu et al. did not analyze the ER status of their breast cancer tissue samples, it is not clear how many of the IL-20 positively tumors were ER-positive. Our IHC analyses showed that the majority of IL-20 positive breast cancer tissues we examined are also ER-positive. However, we did identify some ER-negative breast cancer tissues with IL-20 expression, and the nature of these tumors remains to be characterized.Recently, Lin et al. applied the chromatin immunoprecipitation paired-end diTags (ChIP-PET) technique in MCF-7 cells to identify the ERα binding sites of the whole genome [32]. Of the 1,234 high quality ERα binding sites identified, 71% were ERE-like sites, 25% were putative half-ERE sites, and 4% had no recognizable resemblance to ERE sequences. By integrating gene expression profiling with high-throughput ChIP assays, several reports have indicated that ERα binding to ERE-like sequences is responsible for gene activation [32,33]. Here, a novel imperfect palindromic ERE was found in the IL-20 gene promoter. This promoter was activated by E2-stimulation through the E2-dependent binding of ERα to this imperfect palindromic ERE. Treatment with the ER antagonist ICI abolished both the E2-dependent ERα binding to the ERE-like element and recruitment of RNA Pol II. These results confirm the specificity of the ERα binding to the ERE-like element identified in this study. Furthermore, over-expression of truncated ERα, lacking the DNA binding domain, abolished E2-stimulated induction of IL-20.Luciferase activity was abrogated in the mutated ERE-like element of IL-20 after E2-treatment. Furthermore, the ERE-mutant did not bring down ERα protein in an in vitro oligonucleotide pull-down assay. Results from the earlier genome-wide ChIP-based sequencing analysis performed in MCF-7 cells have indicated that the IL-20 promoter contains a putative ERα binding site [34,35], and this coincides with the ERE-like element identified in this study. Herein, we demonstrated that estradiol (E2)-stimulation of IL-20 over-expression occurs through an ERα-mediated mechanism. E2-liganded ERα binds directly to the IL-20 ERE-like element and recruits co-activator proteins and the RNA Pol II transcription machinery to enhance transcription.We showed that the epigenetic regulation of IL-20 transcription is mediated by the binding of KMT2B to the AF1 domain of ERα. KMT2B is a member of the MLL family, known to be involved in infantile leukemia and tumor cell proliferation [36]. Significantly, no other MLL members were recruited for the E2-dependent activation of IL-20 expression. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of over half of the ERα target genes was affected by KMT2B depletion following E2 treatment. This indicates that KMT2B plays a specific and critical role in the regulation of ERα signaling. Indeed, analysis of three ERα target genes showed that the cis-regulatory elements were bound by KMT2B and regulated by KMT2B-mediated H3K4 modification.ERα transcriptional activation requires the recurrent binding of multiple co-regulators onto its target gene promoters in the presence of continuous estrogen stimulation. The dynamic assembly and dissolution of co-regulators from estrogen responsive promoters following E2-liganded ERα activation and deactivation turns the basal transcription machinery ‘on’ and ‘off’, respectively [37,38]. Within 30 min of the addition of estrogen, co-regulators such as SRC-1, AIB1, H2A.Z, H2ac, and p300 are rapidly recruited to ERα binding sites to activate the expression of ERα target genes [24,37,38]. Furthermore, ERα can recruit histone demethylase enzymes KDM3A, KDM4B, and KDM6B to ERα targeted chromatin to assert histone modification changes [39–41]. Herein, we demonstrated that a histone methyltranferase, KMT2B, plays a significant role in enhancing the transcriptional activity of ERα through the enrichment of active H3K4 methylation. ChIP analysis showed that knockdown of KMT2B reduced H3K4 methylation, and abrogated the recruitment of ERα to cis-regulatory elements adjacent the promoter regions of the ER-target genes IL-20, BCL2, TFF1, and GREB1. Further investigation using whole-genome approaches is necessary to fully elucidate the roles of KMT2B and IL-20 in breast cancer carcinogenesis.We describe that KMT2B and ERα, along with H3K4me enrichment at the promoter, regulate the transcription of ERα target genes, including IL-20, upon E2 treatment. Depletion of IL-20 or KMT2B in E2-stimulated MCF-7 cells abrogated the over-expression of IL-20 mRNA and halted cell proliferation. This suggests that these molecules have potential application in breast cancer diagnosis and as targets for cancer intervention.Materials and MethodsCell culture and transfectionMCF-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For treatment of cells with 17β-estradiol (E2), MCF-7 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium without Phenol Red (Gibco) and supplemented with 5% charcoal-dextran-treated FBS for at least 3 days. E2 and ICI 182,780 (Sigma) were used at concentrations of 10 nM and 100 nM, respectively. MCF-10A cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 0.01 mg/ml insulin, 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone, and 5% horse serum (Sigma). MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.siRNA knockdown and quantitative PCR analysissiRNA targeting ESR1 (siESR1:SASI_Hs01_00078593; siESR1’:SASI_Hs01_00078594; siESR1”:SASI_Hs01_00078595), KMT2A (SASI_Hs01_00090459), KMT2B (siKMT2B:SASI_Hs01_00240396; siKMT2B’:SASI_Hs01_00240397; siKMT2B”:SASI_Hs01_00240398), KMT2C (SASI_Hs01_00037084), KMT2DE (SASI_Hs01_00145443) and KMT2E (SASI_Hs01_00238555) were obtained from MISSION RNA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Cells were transfected with siRNA and Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) for 72 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. MISSION® siRNA Universal Negative Control (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as knockdown control.Total RNA was isolated from cells transfected with siRNA as indicated. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using SYBR Green dye on a Roche Applied Science LightCycler® 2.0 Real-Time PCR System. Briefly, total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in the presence of random hexamers (Invitrogen). All reactions were performed in triplicates with SYBR green master mix (Sigma) and 20M of both the forward and reverse primers according to the manufacturer's recommended thermocycling conditions. Then the PCR products were subjected to melting curve analysis. Finally, the relative gene expression ratio of target genes to 18S rRNA for each sample was calculated. The primer sequences are listed in S1 Table.RNA extraction and Affymetrix microarray analysisTotal RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO). A Human U133 plus 2.0 (Affymetrix) was used for Affymetrix microarray analysis.Transcriptome analysisThe microarray raw data deposited in ArrayExpress (accession E-MTAB-4923) was preprocessed with the justRMA function of the affy Bioconductor package [42] with GeneAnnot based custom CDF (gahgu133plus2 v2.2.1) [43]. The log-2 normalized intensities were adjusted for batch effects by using ComBat function of the sva Bioconductor package [44]. The cmdscale function was used for multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis before and after batch correction. The analyses were performed within the R environment. Two independent breast cancer datasets, TCGA Breast and Gluck Breast, hosted by the Oncomine database (http://www.oncomine.org) were used for differential expression analysis of IL20 of ER-positive and ER-negative tumors in a clinical setting [45].Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) analysisThe promoter nucleotide sequence of IL20 was obtained from UCSC Genome Browser. In the R environment, the promoter sequence was scanned for potential ESR1 motifs using the searchSeq function of the TFBSTools Bioconductor package [46]. The position weight matrices of ESR1, namely MA0112.1, MA0112.2 and MA0112.3, were obtained from the JASPAR2016 Bioconductor data package. Predicted sites that had negative scores or relative scores of less than 0.7 were subsequently removed.Immunohistochemistry (IHC)IHC staining of IL-20 and KMT2B proteins were performed on a breast cancer tissue array (BR1503c, US Biomax). The slides containing tissue sections were baked at 60°C for at least 30 min to melt the paraffin, followed by deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration in graded alcohol into water. The slides were soaked in antigen retrieval buffer (pH 9.0, Dako) and heated in microwave oven for 10 min twice under defrosting condition. The slides were washed with 1X PBS and 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min to inactivated endogenous peroxidase activity. The slides were further incubated with blocking reagent (5% BSA in 1X PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the slides were washed three times with 1X PBS and incubated with primary antibodies against IL-20 (sc-134365) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) and KMT2B (ab104444) (abcam) at 4°C for 16 to 18 h. The slides were washed three times with 1X PBS to remove unbound antibodies and incubated with Dako REAL EnVision™/HRP, Rabbit/Mouse (ENV) (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 20 min at room temperature. Bound primary antibodies were detected with the Dako REAL™ EnVision™ Detection System. Stained sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin, dehydrated and coverslips were mounted using mounting solution for microscopic analysis.ImmunoprecipitationCells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids by using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 36–48 h after DNA transfections for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer. Cleared cellular extracts were then incubated with anti-FLAG at 4°C for 2–4 h. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Western blot was performed using antibodies as indicated.In vitro pull downFLAG fusion proteins were created using an EasyXpress Protein Synthesis kit (QIAGEN) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Briefly, in vitro translated proteins were incubated with anti-FLAG/beads complex at 4°C overnight. The beads were then washed five times in 500 μl of 0.5% NP-40/PBS washing buffer, followed by boiled in 20 ml 2X sample buffer. After this the samples were analyzed by immunoblotting.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIPs) and Re-ChIPs AssaysThe ChIP and Re-ChIP assays were performed as described previously [24]. Briefly, Cell lysates were prepared, sonicated, and immunoprecipitated with anti-KMT2B (ab104444; abcam), anti-ERα (HC-20X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc), anti-RNA Pol II (05-623B; Millipore) or anti-H3K4me1 (07–436; Millipore) antibodies. The protein-DNA cross-linking of the immunoprecipitated complexes were reversed and the DNA was extracted for subsequent Real-Time qPCR analysis. The primer sets for the qPCR are listed in S2 Table. For the Re-ChIP experiments, after the initial ChIP with the first antibody, the protein-DNA complexes were eluted by incubation for 30 min at 37°C in 25 μl 10 mM DTT. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted 20 times with Re-ChIP buffer and subjected again to the ChIP procedure with the second antibody.ELISAInterleukin-20 concentrations were determined in culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) kit, according to the instructions provided by manufacturer (Quantikine human IL-20, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The IL-20-EASIA is a solid phase Enzyme Amplified Sensitivity Immunoassay performed on microtiterplate. The plates were read at O.D. 450 nm in a microplate reader.Luciferase Reporter AssaysThe three serial deletion of 5′ UTR of IL-20 were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA extracted from MCF7 cells with Bgl II and Nco I linkers. These fragments were directionally cloned upstream of the Renilla luciferase ORF of the pGL3-basic vector that also contains a constitutively expressed firefly luciferase gene, which is used to normalize transfections. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. MCF-7 cells were plated into 12- well plates and cotransfected with 0.5 μg pCMV-β-galactosidase reporter vectors in absence or presence of E2 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Experiments were performed in triplicate wells of a 12- well plate and were repeated at least three times.In vitro oligonucleotide pull-down assayIn vitro oligonucleotide pull-down assay was performed as described previously [47].

Eukaryotic eEF1A proteins are active during the elongation phase of protein synthesis, catalyzing the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor site on the ribosome by a GTP-dependent pathway [3]. In addition, eEF1A proteins are multifunctional proteins and interact with major cytoskeletal proteins to organize the cytoskeleton structure by binding to tubulin, actin or other microtubule associated proteins [4]. In plants, eEF1As enhance tolerance to various forms of abiotic stress including wounding, low-temperature, high salt, and drought, possibly by elevating translational efficiency [5–8].More than 80% of plant genes contain one or more introns, with an average density of four introns per gene [9]. Eukaryotic eEF1A genes exhibit a highly conserved structure, each with a relatively large intron in its 5’ untranslated region (5’ UTR). An Arabidopsis eEF1A promoter and its 5’ UTR intron was used in the herbicide resistance gene in commercial RoundupReady® soybean plants [10], but the specific reason for use of those sequences has not been reported.Since the discovery of the first introns in the 1970s [11], considerable effort has been placed into understanding the contributions of introns to gene regulation. Introns can either enhance or repress gene expression, depending on the DNA structure and the nucleotide content of intron flanking sequences [12]. Some introns can also regulate gene expression in a tissue- or development-specific manner [13–15], possibly by providing binding sites for specific transcription factors (TFs) in vivo under certain developmental or environmental conditions.Introns, especially the first intron in the 5’UTR or the coding region (CDS) of a gene, can significantly enhance gene expression in both monocots and dicots [16–17], even though the magnitude of intron enhancement is usually much larger in monocots than in dicots [18]. Introns can enhance transcriptional efficiency either through an interaction between splicing factors and transcription factors, or by changing the chromatin structure into a transcriptionally active state by recruiting unique chromatin-remodeling proteins [19–22]. In addition, splicing signals can influence various stages of mRNA processing, including 5’ capping, 3’ polyadenylation, mRNA nuclear export, translation, and decay of mRNA products [19, 23–24]. At the DNA or RNA level, the presence of an intron affects the transcriptional/translational machinery [23, 25].Introns seem to contain enhancers or regulatory elements that provide binding sites for transcription factors or activators [9]. For instance, a 5’ UTR intron in a soybean polyubiquitin (Gmubi) promoter augmented gene expression with properties of an enhancer, as placement of the intron upstream of the promoter region led to increased expression regardless of orientation [26]. In some cases, the intron itself can function as a promoter, driving weak but consistent gene expression [27–30]. However, in most cases, specific regulatory elements or enhancers contributing to gene expression enhancement cannot be identified from the intron sequence and intron enhancement of gene expression occurs only when the intron is placed within the transcribed region in the proper orientation, so that the intron can be appropriately processed. This type of intron enhancement, specifically termed “intron-mediated enhancement” (IME) [31], likely contributes to gene regulation via intron processing, even though the precise mechanism for enhancement is not completely understood.Although IME has been widely studied, only a few studies have successfully identified specific intronic regulatory elements contributing to intron-mediated enhancement in plants [22, 25, 32–33]. We previously reported that three soybean (Glycine max Merr.) eEF1A promoters, each with a native 5’UTR intron, regulated high levels of gene expression [34]. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the 5’UTR intron from a soybean eEF1A gene (GmScreamM8) [34] on gene regulation by specifically studying the interaction of intronic sequences with a regulatory element from another highly-expressed soybean eEF1A gene (GmScreamM1) [34]. Synthetic promoters/introns consisting of an element tetramer, a core promoter, and variant intronic sequences were transcriptionally fused to a green fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter gene and evaluated using both transient expression in lima bean cotyledons and stable expression in soybean hairy roots. Use of the GmScreamM8 leader intron with proximal or core promoter regulatory elements led to enhanced gene expression.Materials and MethodsPlasmid ConstructsWe previously reported the isolation of the GmScreamM8 promoter using PCR with soybean (G. max cv ‘Jack’) genomic DNA as template [34]. In this study, the GmScreamM8-pFLEV plasmid (GenBank accession number KX252734) was first used as a template to generate a series of GmScreamM8-derived intron variants with the full-length promoter (GmSM8ni, GmSM8InfP, GmSM8InrP, GmSM8InD series, Figs 1 and 2). Primers were designed to contain appropriate restriction sites at the 5’ end of each primer preceded by four or six additional nucleotides (S1 Table). To produce an intron-less version of the promoter (GmSM8ni-pFLEV [ni = no intron]), a reverse primer was specially designed to connect the first and second parts of the GmScreamM8 5’UTR that was originally interrupted by the native intron, while the forward primer was designed at the 5’ end of the GmScreamM8 promoter. To generate GmSM8InfP-pFLEV (Intron upstream of the pre-intronic promoter sequence in a forward orientation) and GmSM8InrP-pFLEV (Intron upstream of the pre-intronic promoter sequence in a reverse orientation) constructs, the 770 bp intronic region was first PCR-amplified using the GmSM8Inf(r)P_F and GmSM8Inf(r)P_R primer pair (S1 Table), in which a HindIII restriction site was introduced at both ends of the fragment. The amplified fragment was digested with HindIII and cloned into the corresponding site in the GmScreamM8-intronless construct (GmSM8ni-pFLEV) in both sense and antisense orientations. The orientation was confirmed by sequencing (Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center, OARDC, The Ohio State University, Wooster, Ohio, USA).

Right: conventional PCR using plasmid DNA of each construct as template.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166074.g002For a series of intron deletion variants, to make sure the intron was efficiently spliced, the 5’ splice site, 3’ splice site, and the branch site were retained in all intron variant constructs, while the rest of intronic sequence named “part 1” (= 702 bp) was further divided into three regions with a similar size, named “part 2” (= 269 bp), “part 3” (= 222 bp), and “part 4” (= 211 bp) (Fig 2a and S1 File). Four intron deletion variants (“GmSM8InD1”, “GmSM8InD2”, “GmSM8InD3”, and “GmSM8InD4”; InD = Intron Deletion) were generated using inverse PCR [35] with some modifications. Each pair of primers was designed in inverted tail-to-tail directions to amplify the whole plasmid sequence except for the targeted region to be deleted (S1 Table). PCR products were purified using a DNA Clean & Concentrator‡-5 kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA), followed by 3’ blunting with DNA Polymerase I, large fragment (Klenow) and 5’ phosphorylation by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The PCR product was then incubated with 20 U DpnI at 37°C for 1 h to remove the parental non-mutated plasmid DNA and then self-ligated using a Quick ligation kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR-positive single colonies were identified and plasmid DNA was isolated and sequenced to confirm the sequence was correct.Element fragments (EF1, EF4, and EF5; EF: Elongation Factor 1A; Figs 3–7 and S1 Fig), containing potential element core sequences predicted by PlantCARE [36] or promoter truncation analysis, were identified from GmScreamM1 (GenBank accession number KX252727) and GmScreamM8 promoters. Element tetramers were generated as described by Rushton et al. [37] with modifications. To generate an element monomer, upper and lower phosphorylated oligonucleotide strands were first annealed together, which created SpeI and XbaI overhangs in the 5’ and 3’ ends, respectively. The annealed fragment was then introduced into a 35Score-pFLEV plasmid [38], previously digested with SpeI and XbaI. To double the copy number of elements, each construct was double digested with SpeI/EcoRI and XbaI/EcoRI, separately. Ligation of two selected fragments doubled the copy number of element fragments in the plasmid, while retaining all other characteristics of the expression vector [37]. In this way, we generated a series of constructs containing element tetramers, upstream of the 35S core promoter (4xEF1-35Score-pFLEV, 4xEF4-35Score-pFLEV, 4xEF5-35Score-pFLEV [S1 Fig]).

The GmSM8C (GmSM8Core with the native leader intron) in pFLEV was generated as previously described (identical to GmScreamM8C in [34], GenBank accession number KX252740). To generate 4xEF4-M8Core-pFLEV and 4xEF4-M8C-pFLEV constructs (Fig 3), the GmScreamM8 core promoter with or without the leader intron in the GmSM8Core-pFLEV and GmSM8C-pFLEV were digested with SalI/NcoI restriction sites and subcloned into 4xEF4-35core-pFLEV to replace the 35S core. To generate 4xEF4-M8CInD series (InD = Intron Deletion; Fig 4), intron partial deletion sequences were PCR-amplified using the GmSM8C_salI_F and GmSM8_R primer pair (S1 Table) with GmSM8InD2-/GmSM8InD3-/GmSM8InD4-pFLEV as templates. The amplified fragments were digested with SalI/NcoI and subcloned into the 4xEF4-M8C-pFLEV plasmid digested by the same restriction enzymes.To generate a series of intron variants with promoter element tetramers (Figs 5–7), inverse PCR was first conducted to add AvrII and NheI sites to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the desired product (4xEF4-M8CInD1-pFLEV or 4xEF4-M8CInD3-pFLEV), respectively. Intron part 2 (IN2), part 3 (IN3), and part 4 (IN4) were PCR-amplified using specific primers with addition of AvrII and NheI restriction sites at the 5’ and 3’ ends, respectively (S1 Table). The copy number of each intronic sequence was manipulated by digesting the constructs with either AvrII or NheI together with EcoRI, which cuts the plasmid at a site outside of the synthetic intron region. Ligation of two selected fragments increased the copy number of the intronic sequence. Construct 4xEF4-M8CIN234 (Fig 5a) and 4xEF4-M8C (Fig 4a) both contained tetrameric repeats of EF4 with the GmScreamM8 core promoter and the whole intron but the former construct contained two additional restriction sites (AvrII/NheI) within the intron, which were needed for cloning.All DNA fragments in this study were PCR-amplified according to the instructions for the FailSafe‡ PCR Kit (Epicenter Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA). The amplified fragments were purified, digested and ligated to the gfp gene in pFLEV, and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α by heat shock. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. For stable expression in soybean hairy roots, the whole expression cassette containing the promoter, the gfp coding region, and the NOS terminator was digested from pFLEV with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned into the binary expression vector pCAMBIA1300 (CAMBIA, Canberra, Australia), which was used for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. All pCAMBIA cloned constructs were also confirmed by sequencing.Gene Expression Quantification and Data AnalysisFor transient expression in lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus cv “Henderson Bush”) cotyledonary tissues, lima bean seeds were first sterilized in 4% (v/v) bleach and germinated in GA7 containers containing moistened paper towels. After 4 d, cotyledons from germinating seedlings were excised and used for particle bombardment as described previously [39–40]. In brief, cotyledons were placed, adaxial surface up, on a growth regulator free plant tissue culture medium to acclimate for 1–4 h. Cotyledons were then removed, placed on a stainless steel mesh supporting screen, and bombarded with tungsten particles coated with different DNA constructions using the Particle Inflow Gun [41]. After the cotyledons were returned to the medium, dishes were mounted on a 2 dimensional robotics platform positioned under a MZFLII dissecting fluorescence microscope (Leica, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) and images of each cotyledon were collected every hour for 100 h [40, 42]. To prevent the formation of condensation on the lid of the Petri dish, which would interfere with image capture, the Petri dish lid was replaced with 6.5 mm thick sterile polycarbonate disc [43]. Captured images of cotyledonary tissue showing levels of GFP expression driven by different promoter/element constructs were analyzed as described by Hernandez-Garcia et al. [39]. In brief, each collected series of 100 images for each promoter was first manually aligned using Adobe ImageReady to make certain that the same GFP-expressing area in each cotyledon was analyzed over the 100 h duration of each experimental run. A 400 x 300 pixel area of each image series was selected and used for further analysis of GFP intensity measurement using ImageJ [44]. Batch images were separated into red, green, and blue channels, and background gray values (obtained from a non-GFP expressing region of the cotyledon) were subtracted from each image at each time point. The background-corrected GFP intensity was then calculated by multiplying the mean grayscale value per pixel in the red and green channels by the total number of GFP-expressing pixels to provide a measure of total GFP expression. For each construct, 6–9 cotyledons were bombarded in total, with two or three independent biological replications. The final value of GFP expression for each construct was calculated by averaging the values of GFP expression obtained from the 6–9 individual bombarded cotyledons.For generation of stably transformed soybean hairy roots, soybean (G. max cv “Williams 82”) seeds were sterilized and germinated as described above for the lima bean seeds. After 6 d, cotyledons were excised and inoculated with Agrobacterium rhizogenes K599 harboring the pCAMBIA1300 vector containing different promoter/element variants [39]. Images of young rapidly growing GFP-expressing hairy roots (~2 cm) were collected using the MZFLIII dissecting microscope equipped with a GFP2 filter set (Ex. 480±40 nm; Em. 510 nm LP), and a Spot-RT CCD digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). GFP intensity was quantified using ImageJ software as previously described [39]. In brief, images of individual roots were separated into red, green and blue channels, and GFP intensity was measured by calculating the background-corrected grayscale mean value using only the green channel. GFP expression values for each promoter construct were calculated by subtracting the grayscale mean value of hairy roots induced by A. rhizogenes without the binary vector from an average value for the GFP-expressing hairy roots. For each construct, 15–35 independent transgenic events were generated and analyzed, with at least two independent replications. Comparisons between different constructs were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. The significant difference between the means was analyzed using a Student’s t test (LSD) at p<0.05.Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR)Total RNAs of soybean (G. max cv “Williams 82”) hairy roots (2–3 cm) transformed with or without variant constructs (GmScreamM8, GmSM8ni, GmSM8InD1, GmSM8InD2, GmSM8InD3, and GmSM8InD4) were isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). RNA quality was checked by gel electrophoresis and quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). For reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) using a RETROscript‡ Kit (AMBION INC, Austin, TX, USA), the first cDNA strand was synthesized using 2 μg RNA and 1 μl random decamers in a reaction volume of 14 μl in total, followed by incubation at 85°C for 3 min, 44°C for 1h, and 92°C for 10 min. Using the synthesized cDNA as template, PCR was performed using specific primers (M8intron_RT_F/R primers; S1 Table) flanking the leader intron. The size of PCR products was checked by gel electrophoresis. PCR products were then gel purified and sequenced to determine if the intron was totally processed and removed.IMEter ScoreThe enhancing ability of the full GmScreamM8 intron or intron fragments was evaluated using IMEter v2.1 (S2 Table) [25]. IMEter scores were calculated by submitting the full GmScreamM8 leader intron or partial intron sequences (part 2, part 3, part 4). “Glycine max” (soybean) was selected as the species in the database to evaluate the enhancing ability of the intron/intron fragments.ResultsThis two-tiered validation approach allowed an initial rapid assessment of promoter activity using transient expression, followed by a slightly slower but still rapid analysis in stably-transformed soybean hairy roots. With the constitutively-expressed promoters and regulatory regions selected for this study, gene expression intensities measured using transient expression were largely confirmed in stably-transformed roots.The Leader Intron Increased GmScreamM8 (Soybean eEF1A) Promoter ActivityTo evaluate the effect of the GmScreamM8 leader intron on the high activity of the GmScreamM8 promoter, intron deletion and translocation constructs were generated and validated using both transient expression in lima bean cotyledons and stable expression in soybean hairy roots (Fig 1). The intron-containing GmScreamM8 promoter construct gave much higher transient GFP expression, compared to the intron-less GmSM8ni promoter construct (Fig 1b). Translocation of the intron sequence upstream of the pre-intronic sequence of the GmScreamM8 promoter in both sense (GmSM8InfP) and antisense (GmSM8InrP) orientations yielded lower levels of transient expression compared with the GmScreamM8 promoter, with somewhat higher expression from the upstream placement of the intron in the sense orientation (Fig 1b). Stably-transformed soybean hairy root events from the intron-less (GmSM8ni) and intron translocation constructs (GmSM8InfP; GmSM8InrP) all showed similar expression levels that were not significantly different from each other (Fig 1c). The GmScreamM8 promoter, with the full intron in its native position, gave the highest expression in soybean hairy roots (Fig 1c). The expression patterns were the same for all hairy roots, as all roots displayed higher expression in the root elongation zone and root tips (Fig 1c).To further dissect the intronic sequences that enhanced gene expression, the full-length native promoter was evaluated with four intron internal deletions (Fig 2). Three of the four intron internal deletion constructs (Fig 2a), GmSM8InD2, GmSM8InD3, and GmSM8InD4, gave rise to a level of transient GFP expression lower than the full intron-containing GmScreamM8 promoter but higher than the intron-less construct GmSM8ni (Fig 2b). In stably transformed soybean hairy roots, the three deletion constructs drove levels of GFP expression significantly lower than the GmScreamM8 promoter but higher than GmSM8ni (Fig 2c). Another large intron deletion construct, GmSM8InD1, in which the majority of the intron sequence (parts 2, 3, and 4) was removed, displayed very weak but detectable activity in both transient and stable expression analyses (Fig 2). Reverse transcription PCR revealed that intron splicing took place with all the constructs except GmSM8InD1, where the intron was not processed, leading to a larger amplicon (Fig 2d, left). This was further confirmed by sequencing.The Leader Intron Enhanced the Activity of Proximal Promoter ElementsTo simplify the identification of the intronic sequence that contributed to high gene expression, a synthetic promoter consisting of an element tetramer and a core promoter was developed (Fig 3). The element tetramer, EF4, was selected as it showed the highest activity among several element-containing fragments from GmScream promoters (S1 Fig). Different combinations of the EF4 tetramer from GmScreamM1 with the 35S core or GmScreamM8 core promoter, with and without the GmScreamM8 intron, showed that the tetramer with the GmScreamM8 core and GmScreamM8 intron gave the highest activity (Fig 3). This high activity was observed using both transient expression in lima bean cotyledons (Fig 3b) and stable expression in transgenic soybean hairy roots (Fig 3c).Using transient expression analysis, the construct containing the GmScreamM8 core plus the native leader intron (4xEF4-M8C) showed 33-fold higher expression compared to its counterpart without the intron (4xEF4-M8Core). Another intron-containing construct (4xEF4-35Score-M8Intron) with the 35S core promoter rather than the GmScreamM8 core promoter also displayed significantly enhanced gene expression in comparison with its intron-less counterpart (4xEF4-35Score) (Fig 3b). In addition, the GmScreamM8 core promoter showed seven-fold higher activity when the intron was present (GmSM8C), even if no additional tetrameric promoter sequences were upstream. However, use of the leader intron did not show any enhancement of gene expression when it was cloned downstream of the 35S core promoter without the EF4 tetramer (Fig 3b).In transformed soybean hairy roots, the 4xEF4-M8C construct showed the highest expression among all the element-intron variants (Fig 3c), similar to what was seen using transient expression analysis. Intron-containing constructs (4xEF4-35Score-M8Intron; 4xEF4-M8C) drove significantly higher GFP expression than the counterparts without the intron (4xEF4-35Score; 4xEF4-M8Core) and the constructs containing only a core promoter and the intron but without the regulatory element tetramer (35Score-M8Intron; GmSM8C) (Fig 3c). For core promoters (35Score or GmSM8Core), the intensity of GFP expression in stably-transformed hairy roots was significantly increased by 2–4 fold if the EF4 tetramer was present upstream (Fig 3c). However, use of either core promoter (35Score or GmSM8Core) without the EF4 tetramer, and either with or without the intron (35Score-M8Intron; GmSM8C), resulted in low but still detectable expression levels (Fig 3c).Deletion of a 222 bp Intron Internal Sequence Led to Reduced ActivityUsing transient expression analysis of constructs containing the EF4 tetramer, the GmScreamM8 core, and three different intron deletions, reduced expression was obtained only when part 3 of the intron (4xEF4-M8CInD3; Fig 4a) was deleted, while deletion of part 2 (4xEF4-M8CInD2) or part 4 (4xEF4-M8CInD4) did not significantly influence the intensity of gene expression compared to the control 4xEF4-M8C, which possessed a full intron (Fig 4b). In stably transformed hairy roots, GFP expression driven by 4xEF4-M8CInD3 was significantly lower than all other constructs. For the other deletion constructs, 4xEF4-M8CInD2 displayed a significant lower activity than the control 4xEF4-M8C, while 4xEF4-M8CInD4 did not show a significant difference (Fig 4c).Analysis of three additional intron variants (Fig 5a), where intron parts 2, 3, and 4 were individually evaluated, revealed that the 4xEF4-M8CIN3 gave two-fold higher GFP transient expression than the control 4xEF4-M8CIN234 (same to 4xEF4-M8C with addition of two restriction sites; see Materials and Methods), which possessed the intact intron (Fig 5b). In stably-transformed hairy roots, 4xEF4-M8CIN3 showed comparable activity to 4xEF4-M8CIN234, and significantly higher expression than 4xEF4-M8CIN2 and 4xEF4-M8CIN4 (Fig 5c).Further analysis of intron variants (Fig 6a) revealed that the monomeric and the trimeric repeat of the 222 bp intronic sequence (4xEF4-M8CIN3; 4xEF4-M8CIN333) gave approximately two-fold higher expression compared to the control 4xEF4-M8CIN234 using transient expression analysis (Fig 6b). A “stuffed” intron (4xEF4-M8CIN23334), which contained a trimeric repeat of intron part 3 and a single copy of intron part 2 and part 4, showed lower expression than the construct containing only one copy of intron part 3 (4xEF4-M8CIN3), but higher expression than the control 4xEF4-M8CIN234. Another intron variant 4xEF4-M8CIN234234, showed 1.5X higher expression than 4xEF4-M8CIN234, but still lower than 4xEF4-M8CIN3 (Fig 6b). For stable expression in soybean hairy roots, the stuffed intron (4xEF4-M8CIN23334) showed the highest expression compared to other intron variants, and a significant difference was observed between the stuffed intron and the control 4xEF4-M8CIN234 (Fig 6c).DNA sequencing revealed that the 222 bp intronic sequence mainly contained an array of two and a half short imperfect repeats, in lengths of 60 bp, 60 bp, and 30 bp (Fig 7a and 7b). Deletion of the whole repeated sequence within the intron (4xEF4-M8CIN3D1) led to 50% decrease of GFP expression in transient expression as well as a significant decrease in GFP expression in stably-transformed hairy roots, while retention of the first 60 bp repeat sequence (4xEF4-M8CIN3D2) did not restore the activity of the whole repeated sequence (4xEF4-M8CIN3), as evaluated using both transient and stable expression (Fig 7c and 7d).DiscussionTransient ExpressionUse of the automated image collection and analysis system with GFP allowed for continual monitoring of promoter activity over 100 h (Figs 1–7), generating consistent results for measurement of promoter strength. This approach has been used previously with constitutively expressed promoters [26, 39] as well as wound-inducible promoters [39] and promoter elements [38]. This same transient expression approach was also used for rapid validation of the GmScream promoters [34], and showed that the GmScreamM1, GmScreamM4 and GmScreamM8 promoters were the most highly active promoters in this group. The specific gfp gene that was used in this research is an earlier version of the gene and the protein displays moderate fluorescence and stability [45], compared with other green fluorescent proteins, which have been modified for increased fluorescence and higher stability [46–47]. The GFP fluorescence reported here should therefore be more indicative of promoter activity than other reporter genes, which give rise to more stable products and may still be measured, long after the promoter becomes inactive. Although it may have been useful to evaluate either GUS or luciferase activity, regulated by a constitutive promoter, as an internal standard [48], this approach was not feasible using a continual monitoring system as GUS and luciferase assays are destructive and can only be used for single time point assays. In this research, GFP expression was evaluated and quantified over time based on image analysis of a defined area of GFP-expressing cells in bombarded tissue. GFP levels were calculated based on background-corrected average gray value in the green and red channels across thousands of transiently expressing cells [42], in 6–9 cotyledons, from 2–3 separate experiments. This approach has been useful for quantification of the effects of promoters [39], intron-variants [26] and cis-regulatory elements [38], and seems to be useful for evaluation of the promoter and intron variants described in this research.Stable Expression in Hairy RootsPromoter-mediated gene expression levels in stably transformed soybean hairy roots were largely reflective of the levels obtained using transient expression analysis (Figs 1–5 and 7), with slight inconsistency across systems in certain instances (Fig 6). Use of hairy roots to validate promoter constructs may lead to slightly different outcomes, as transgene expression in hairy roots and other transgenic organs is influenced by genome methylation as well as conformational and positional effects in genomic DNA [39]. GFP expression in stably transformed roots showed some variability, which was previously demonstrated to be associated with transgene copy number [39]. Our rapid and simple stable transformation assays in soybean hairy roots was extremely useful for rapid introduction and validation of many different promoter constructs, since recovery of transgenic soybean plants requires extended time and effort [49]. In this study, production of 15–35 stably transformed hairy roots for each promoter construct, from two independent experiments, took weeks rather than months. In addition, hairy roots are well suited for GFP detection, as they do not contain chlorophyll, which can interfere GFP detection due to chlorophyll autofluorescence [50]. Although use of hairy roots for promoter analysis does have some limitations, evaluation of gene expression in stably transformed soybean hairy roots can be a good general indicator of promoter strength in whole transgenic plants [26, 34, 38].Intron-Mediated EnhancementRemoval of the leader intron from the original GmScreamM8 promoter (GmSM8ni, Fig 1) resulted in 60% decrease in gene expression, suggesting that the leader intron significantly contributed to the high activity of the ~1.5 kb promoter (Fig 1). The GmScreamM8 leader intron is located only 77 bp downstream of the TSS of the native soybean eEF1A gene. As with other stimulating introns, the close proximity of the 5’UTR intron to the TSS may allow better access of the transcriptional initiation machinery to the intron [51–52], enhancing transcription initiation. In addition, the first introns relative to other introns of the same gene usually display significant enrichment of active chromatin marks, further indicating certain regions in first introns have potential regulatory roles [53].Introduction of intron translocation constructs (GmSM8InfP and GmSM8InrP) (Fig 1) did not lead to high GFP expression, suggesting that the GmScreamM8 leader intron did not contain classical enhancers that could increase gene expression independent of the position and orientation. Using the same validation tools reported here, upstream translocation of the leader intron from the soybean polyubiquitin (Gmubi) promoter in both orientations led to increased expression levels, indicating that enhancers were present in that intron sequence [26]. Unlike the Gmubi intron, the GmScreamM8 leader intron enhanced gene expression via intron-mediated enhancement, as the stimulating intron needed to be placed close to, and downstream of the transcription start site in the proper orientation [54].Partial deletion of intronic regions (part 2, part 3, part 4) in GmScreamM8 did not completely abolish intron enhancement of gene expression (Fig 2), but resulted in different levels of reduction in expression, indicating a redundancy of IME signals, which is common with this type of intron [55], possibly due to the interactions of intronic regulatory sequences throughout the GmScreamM8 intron and the multiple proximal promoter regulatory motifs. Redundancy of IME signals can complicate the identification of intron sequence motifs responsible for intron enhancement, because each motif can influence IME in different ways, depending on the number of intron regulatory motifs and the proximity of the motifs to the promoter elements.Analysis of intron partial deletion constructs with the full-length promoter showed that the partial deletions reduced promoter activity (Fig 2). The largest intron deletion construct GmSM8InD1 (Fig 2), with only a 68 bp intron sequence remaining, showed very low but detectable GFP expression in both transient and stable expression assays. This was the only intron-containing construct, where the intron was not processed (Fig 2d). The failure in intron processing with the GmSM8InD1 construct likely affected mRNA stability and translation efficiency by interruption of the reading frame [54], or by triggering nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) [56]. Splicing failure of GmSM8InD1 could have resulted from a short intron size [57], where removal of the majority of the intronic regulatory elements/enhancers resulted in very inefficient splicing. However, the role of splicing on IME is still not clear. Splicing alone is not sufficient to induce IME [58] since not all spliceosomal introns can enhance gene expression [25]. But, splicing is often necessary for IME [32].Use of Synthetic Promoters and Synthetic Introns for Intron Sequence EvaluationUse of a full-length promoter upstream of a stimulating intron clearly demonstrated an interaction between the promoter and the GmScreamM8 leader intron (Figs 1 and 2) but it was difficult to identify the interacting components using the full-length promoter and the intron. Although IME has previously been studied using full-length native promoters along with introns and intron deletion variants [22, 31, 59–60], use of synthetic promoters consisting of an element tetramer and a minimal promoter to study IME has not previously been reported.Although the 35S core has been widely used for evaluation of cis-regulatory elements due to its low background expression and efficient transcriptional initiation [61], the GmScreamM8 core was more efficient than the 35S core for intron sequence evaluation, as the leader intron exhibited a larger gene enhancement with the GmScreamM8 core compared to the 35S core using our transient and stable expression assays, with or without the element tetramer upstream of core promoters (Fig 3). Use of our synthetic promoters, consisting of the EF4 tetramer and the GmScreamM8 core promoter assembled upstream of the intact intron or intron variants (Figs 4–7), allowed for a robust assessment of the interaction between the promoter element and the intron components, with no apparent interference from additional regulatory sequences in the full-length promoter. Our modified plasmids facilitated the evaluation of candidate intronic sequences with small tetrameric promoter fragments, using rapid transient expression analysis and stable expression assays.Use of synthetic introns (Figs 6 and 7) holds great potential for identification and evaluation of intron regulatory elements conferring IME. With synthetic introns, intron sequences of interest can be evaluated by manipulating the copy number and sequences of intron regions (Fig 6). These types of intron variants, in addition to the intron translocation constructs (Fig 1) and the partial internal deletion constructs (Figs 4, 5 and 7), can be very useful for identifying intron components that contribute to increased gene expression. As demonstrated here, evaluation of synthetic intron constructs using synthetic promoters, consisting of various core sequences with tetrameric promoter element repeats has not previously been reported.Intron Regulatory Motifs for IMEOur results suggested that a 222 bp intronic sequence (part 3) was an important contributor to IME from the GmScreamM8 leader intron (Figs 4–6). Further truncation of the repeated sequence within the intron led to dramatic reductions in GFP expression (Fig 7), indicating that the whole repeated sequence contributed to high levels of gene expression. The repeated sequence may contribute to conformational changes, making the promoter more accessible for transcription factors and RNA polymerase II [62], or facilitating the interaction of splicing factors with upstream transcription factors [27]. Alternatively, the repeated sequence possibly contained regulatory sequences involved in IME; however, we were not able to identify any candidate intron regulatory sequences using ERISdb [63], possibly due to the limited knowledge of intron regulatory elements in plants. Nevertheless, we found that the repeated sequence was T-rich, with T-nucleotides accounting for more than 40% of the whole sequence. A T-rich region within the maize Sh1 first intron was required for the maximum levels of intron enhancement [32]. In addition, a TAGATC was found in the three imperfect repeated sequences of our GmScreamM8 leader intron (Fig 7). The TAGATC sequence was similar to an overrepresented sequence of TA/CGATC/G in rice stimulating introns [64] and a pentamer CGATT in the Arabidopsis UBQ10 intron [25, 64], which were identified as important regulatory elements for IME. For the other two intron fragments studied here, the part 2 region showed very limited effects on the IME, while the part 4 displayed a negative effect (Figs 4–6), indicating silencers or regulatory sequences inhibiting gene transcription existed in the part 4 of the intron. Analysis of the IMEter scores of the different intron parts using IMEter v2.1 [25] revealed that the intron part 2 region had the strongest IME signal (S2 Table). Although IME signals may show conserved features among some plants [25], analysis of the leader intron using IMEter v2.1 did not reveal the sequence that contributed to high gene expression.Taken together, the middle part of the GmScreamM8 leader intron (part 3), which contained potential regulatory elements for IME, seemed to contribute greatly to the enhancement of GFP expression, while the part 4 of the intron may contain negative regulatory sequences for the regulation of gene expression.ConclusionsWe report here an interplay between a leader intron from a native soybean GmScreamM8 promoter and a regulatory element of the GmScreamM1 promoter to regulate gene expression. The GmScreamM8 leader intron increased gene expression through intron-mediated enhancement. Using a synthetic promoter approach and synthetic introns, we identified a short repeated intronic region of the GmScreamM8 leader intron that significantly contributed to the observed IME. This approach could be useful for the identification and validation of other intron regulatory components for gene enhancement, thus improving our understanding of the mechanisms of IME. The GmScreamM8 intron and possibly other introns have the potential to increase, stabilize or modulate transgene expression when used in transgenic plants, either in their native form, or as synthetic introns.Supporting InformationS1 Fig. Validation of synthetic promoters containing tetrameric copies of element-containing fragments.(a) DNA sequences of EF1, EF4 and EF5.

Silicosis can progressively evolve to lung impairment, respiratory failure and death, even after occupational exposure has ceased.[1–3]Usually, this process is chronic and may require up to 10 or more years to fully develop; however, acute or accelerated forms of silicosis may occur, even though less frequently.No effective specific treatment for silicosis is available; however, comprehensive supportive care can be provided in order to slow the natural history of the disease and to improve patient’s quality of life. Further, some clinically selected patients may be considered eligible for receiving lung transplantation.[1–4]Hazardous occupational exposures to silica dust can involve a variety of workers, including those engaged in mining, quarrying, denim sandblasting and abrasive blasting, sand and gravel screening, rock drilling and crushing, roads, highways and bridges construction, demolition and repair, pottery making, stone masonry, and tunneling operations, among others.[5] Recently, silicosis cases resulting from hazardous exposure to silica during hydrofracking of gas and oil wells or exposure to quartz surfacing materials, such as artificial quartz conglomerates, during construction and installation of engineered stone kitchens and bathrooms, have been reported.[5–7]Thanks to the introduction of proper preventive workplace practices and legislative measures, both the morbidity and the mortality of silicosis have been gradually declined throughout time.[5,8]However, there is a dearth of information concerning silicosis-related interest at the level of scientific community, policy- and educational-makers, media coverage, and new information and communication technologies (ICTs) in terms of scientific production, financial supporting and funding, legislative measures and actions, news reporting and web activities, and public understanding and engagement, respectively. The relationship between science, public engagement and the institutional organisms and bodies is multifaceted and extremely complex.[9] Scientists as “public communicators” [10] communicate and interact with journalists, who divulge, simplify and, sometimes, amplify the severity of diseases or health risks.[11] Sensationalism, imbalance and distortion can affect the proper reporting of the news.[12] Further, scientists can be, as well, publicly engaged and can, directly or indirectly, influence normative aspects. Research is supported by policy-makers and other stakeholders, and, as such, scientists have to share their findings, according to the principles of accountability, transparency and responsibility. In conclusion, science is “inherently political”.[13]. On the other hand, policy should be based on the latest updated scientific evidences (the so-called “evidence-based policy making”), both in the fields of Public and Occupational Health.[14]In the contemporary society, the widespread use of the Web has revolutionized the interface between science, the public and the media-public interaction. Phenomena such as “citizen science” or “citizen journalism” (known also as “collaborative journalism”) have lead to unprecedented forms of participation and collaboration, in which lay people play “an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information”.[15] In particular, within the framework of e-health or health 2.0, new modalities, strategies, and practices of health care delivery have, indeed, emerged, that exploit, and are supported by, electronic processes and communication, and by a more and more dynamic and interactive information reality. This is the context of the Web 2.0 as a further evolution of the static reality that characterized the Web 1.0: the difference and the distance between webmasters and Web surfers have now become blurred, since the users are, at the same time, consumers and producers (that is to say, prosumers) of the Web contents.[16–18]Within e-health, the patients are at the center of the health care processes, in that they are more involved and informed of the many steps of medical decision making. All the virtual activities carried out by lay people while surfing health-related sites and/or while communicating and sharing their health statuses are known as novel, fast or big data, in that they represent an incredible wealth of data, which are quickly available to researchers.Web searches are a complex phenomenon, depending on an array of variables, which include logistic-organizational factors such as the Internet penetration index, user demographics, the searched disease (i.e., incidence, severity, natural history), media coverage, and public and occupational health actions (i.e., preventive interventions, surveillance and legislative measures), among others (Fig 1).[9,19]          Download:                            PPT                                PowerPoint slide                                PNG                                larger image                                  ()                                  TIFF                                original image                                  ()                Fig 1.  Conceptual framework showing the complex links between scientific community, policy- and education-makers, traditional news coverage and novel data streams, and the public engagement.Adapted and modified from Ref. [19].              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166051.g001In the extant literature, very little is known about the Internet-activities behaviors of patients with chronic-degenerative diseases. Digital tools have been, so far, exploited for capturing interest towards acute diseases[20, 21]. Online tracking systems for early detection of outbreaks are plagued by some methodological issues [22,23] that need to be carefully addressed.[24] The field of behavioral medicine remains, instead, largely unexplored. [25] Traditional surveillance suffers from intrinsic limitations: new and enhanced methods for identification of cases and assessment of disease patterns and trends are, therefore, urgently needed.[24] All over the world, chronic and occupational diseases are under-reported, even if all the countries are legally obliged to use registration systems that provide information on disease-related incidence and prevalence. New digital tools for the epidemiological surveillance of the occupational diseases could be useful to fill in this gap.[26]. Timely and complete reporting is, indeed, fundamental for a successful, physician-based public health surveillance system, especially for the surveillance of occupational health conditions.[27,28]In particular, there is a dearth of studies focusing on chronic respiratory diseases. Further, findings are contrasting. Delgado and collaborators interviewed 382 subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and they found that 51.6% of the subjects had a computer, 49.7% accessed the Internet, and 13.9% used it to search for information about COPD. The Internet was predominantly accessed by male and younger subjects. Predictors of searching for information about COPD on the Internet were: having a computer, reporting a low dyspnea score, and being of a high socioeconomic level.[29] On the contrary, Duplaga found that, in Poland, 200 patients with COPD reported high levels of acceptance of e-health applications and access to information.[30] Moreover, ICTs seem to enable the design and implementation of a person-centered healthcare delivery for patients suffering from COPD at different steps: from prevention to treatment and rehabilitation.[31–33].Changes in natural history of diseases or emerging pathogens foster the scientific community to investigate a potential cure or a preventive approach.[34–36] In their turns, scientific production and discoveries trigger news coverage, which, increasing the visibility of articles and contributing to their dissemination and communication, may influence the public behavior, in terms, for example, of interest and digital activities. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies addressing scientific production and web-activities related to occupational diseases.The present study aims at filling in this gap. We decided to focus on silicosis because it represents a classical occupational disease and also at the light of a renewed interest for this pathology, due to the recently occurred cases clusters.Material and MethodsBig Data analyticsA variety of tools and statistical/computational approaches have been used. They are summarized in Table 1, to which the reader is referred for further details and information.

Statistical tools and computational approaches used in the current manuscript.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166051.t001Google Trends (GT) has been successfully used in a variety of health-related disciplines, investigating the web activities concerning both non-communicable and communicable diseases, for different purposes, ranging from disease monitoring to assessment of public interest towards certain disorders, as recently reviewed by Nuti and collaborators.[37] GT was searched worldwide, using \"silicosis\" as “search topic” (Disease) keyword, in that using this option, all searches related to the query and automatically suggested by GT via its auto-complete service were included.In the literature Wikitrends has been used to explore information-seeking behavior for epilepsy [38,39] or in order to understand searches concerning scientific and technological terms of broad interest.[9] Wikitrends could reflect academic education.[9]In the extant literature, Google News has been exploited to investigate coverage regarding smoking cessation campaign or for evaluating the impact of advocacy.[40–42] Twitter has been used to investigate interest toward a wide range of diseases, such as cancer or infectious diseases, among others. It has been exploited to quantitatively assess the effect of advocacy as well [42] or the impact of scientific conferences.[43]Data miningAll the above-mentioned tools were mined using an in-house script, which facilitated the process of data collection, parsing, handling, processing and normalization.Content analysisTweets and videos were analyzed according to the following variables: year of publication, number of likes and re-tweets for the tweets, and number of likes and comments for the videos, the nature of the material (institutional or not), if mentioning that silicosis is an occupational preventable disease or not, which occupational activity can cause the silicosis (i.e., fracking, sandblasting, mining, working in textile or automotive industries).Statistical analysisThe relationships among scientific production (as measured using PubMed and Google Scholar, in terms of published articles), media coverage (as measured using Google news), search attitude (as measured using GT for lay people and Wikitrends for educational communities, in terms of search and traffic volumes) [9], and prosumer behavior (as measured using YouTube and Twitter) related to silicosis were investigated.All the collected silicosis-related data were modeled as a time series and time-trend was investigated using the Mann-Kendall test and the change-point detection analysis.Multivariate regression and generalized linear models were performed to understand the silicosis-related interest and activities. More in details, the scientific production was measured using standard bibliometric parameters (countries/territories, number of quotations, impact factor) as well as recently introduced visibility and impact scores (such as Altmetric score). Web activities were assessed according to the number of re-tweets, hash-tags, comments, and likes.Pearson’s coefficient (r coefficient) was calculated with a commercial software, namely the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software, version 21.0.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). The strength of correlation was measured using the rule of thumb described by Hinkle and coauthors: negligible correlation with r coefficient in the range 0.00–0.30, low correlation with r in the range 0.30–0.50, moderate correlation with r in the range 0.50–0.70, high correlation with r in the range 0.70–0.90, and very high correlation with r in the range 0.90–1.00.[44]Besides correlational analysis, hierarchical clustering was performed in order to dissect the relationship among the different interest patterns and behaviors (namely, scientific production, news coverage and web-activities). The output of the hierarchical cluster vas visually inspected by means of a dendrogram.Figures with a p-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsScientific productionThe scientific production related to silicosis has been globally decreasing from the sixties onwards, with a recent increasing trend in the last decade (with peaks observable in the years 2003, 2005, 2007–2008, 2011, 2013, and 2015) (Fig 2). Some articles have been particular popular, reaching an Altmetric score of 15, being covered by the media and probably contributing to generate tweets and discussion among lay people. Moreover, as far as geospatial localization of silicosis-related scientific production is concerned, this is mainly based in Europe (49.7% of the scientific output) and the USA (24.5% of the scientific output). These two areas together contribute to more than two thirds of the entire scientific production worldwide. China, Russia, South Africa, India, and Turkey contribute to 5.9%, 3.6%, 3.1%, 2.8% and 1.4%, respectively. The Central and South Americas produced the 2.7% of the entire scholarly amount.

According to the Mann-Kendall test and the change-point detection analysis, the search volumes in coincidence of the peaks statistically differed from the web activities in the remaining study period (p<0.0001). Geospatially, the queries were concentrated in the Latin American countries (Chile, Colombia, Peru, Brazil) and in South Africa, less in European countries (Spain, Germany, Italy and Romania) and in Turkey.

The majority of Tweets were written in English, the remaining ones in Spanish, Portuguese, Afrikaans, Hindi/Urdu, Bengalese, Farsi, Chinese, Korean, Russian, French, Albanian, Slovenian, Italian, Norwegian, Danish, Arabic and Swedish. Nearly to 10% of the tweets concerned cases of silicosis occurred in North America, 6.6% in South America (mainly, in Chile), 17.7% in Europe (mainly, in Spain and UK), 52.9% in Africa, 12.6% in Asia (mainly, in India, Pakistan and China) and 0.2% in Oceania.Approximately 13.4% of tweets of tweets explicitly mentioned that silicosis is caused by exposure to silica dust, 8.6% that is a preventable disease, 18.4% that is an occupational disease, and 0.3% that this condition can lead to death. Some tweets mention historical episodes, including the well-known Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster near Gauley Bridge, West Virginia, USA; others quote normative measures, such as the USA standards to limit worker exposure recently proposed in 2013 and updating those set in 1971, or class actions, such as the Treatment Action Campaign (TACT) or the TB/Silicosis class act promoted by attorney Richard Spoor on 21st December 2012 in South Africa seeking class certification for nearly 17,000 ex-gold miners. Some tweets mention preventive measures, such as technological progress in designing new abrasive blasting procedures with a decreased exposure to silica. Other tweets mention the story of a Chinese gold-miner, He Quangui, recently portrayed in the film “Dying to breathe”. There are references also to art and poetry: the verses of the American poet Muriel Rukeyser and her “Book of the Dead”, commemorating the Hawk's Nest incident. Interestingly, 12.1% of tweets had a personal content, with an increasing trend throughout the years.Similarly, likes, re-tweets and number of hash-tags increased significantly throughout time (F = 6.43, p<0.0001; F = 25.49, p<0.0001; and F = 66.02, p<0.0001, respectively), being significantly influenced by place (F = 5.60, p<0.0001; F = 41.86, p<0.0001; F = 27.85, p<0.0001). The personal nature of the tweet correlated with the number of likes, whilst the number of hash-tags was associated with the content of the tweet.(Figs 6 and 7)          Download:                            PPT                                PowerPoint slide                                PNG                                larger image                                  ()                                  TIFF                                original image                                  ()                Fig 6.

This attracted considerable media coverage At the level of lay people, this renewed interest can be captured by GT, which together with Wikitrends, documents superimposable peaks (spikes observable in Figs 3 and 5).Further, we found that silicosis-related activities were particularly concentrated in the Latin America and South Africa, where silicosis is still exacting a heavy toll [46], possibly reflecting the need of prosumers for proper information and prevention measures to avoid the exposure to novel risk-factors.Thus, our results confirm that both changes in risk exposure and in the natural history of the disease reflect on the related scientific production, media coverage and on search behaviors. We had already noticed this effect in the case of Ebola epidemics [12]. In the case of silicosis, acute massive forms of silicosis have attracted considerable attention and consideration from the public engagement, making evident new form of occupational hazards and exposure to silica and gaps in the workplace safety.Increase in likes, comments, hash-tags, re-tweets supports an increased interest from the public engagement: the personal nature and content of the web-related activities and material are growing too throughout time with alternating peaks linked to advocacy events [47; 48]. While the half-life of searches and queries is relatively short, the other web-activities, as well as scientific production and news-reporting behaviors, have a longer half-life.However, there is a knowledge gap. No more than 10% of tweets and posted/uploaded material provide scientific-based, accurate information.In order to plan and improve adequate preventive programs and large-scale interventions both in public health and occupational field, reliable data are necessary.[27] For this reason, new smart digital systems can be exploited to implement knowledge about the existing or new diseases.[9]Future studies should investigate online interventions aimed at increasing awareness and knowledge about occupational diseases, in particular about preventive measures that can be adopted in order to safely work without undergoing the risk to exposing to hazardous material.[27]Our study had some limitations. The major of GT is the lack of detailed information on the method by which Google generates these search data, and the algorithms it employs to analyze them. GT data were available only in the form of relative volume and not as absolute values, enabling further data handling and manipulation. Furthermore, temporal changes in the interface and capabilities of GT over time are not documented, which may lead to variations in the search output and in turn the study findings. Thus, the interpretation of the findings may depend on the chosen time window and geographical area. Furthermore, GT is able to capture only the search behavior of a certain segment of the population—those with Internet access and those using Google rather than other search engines (although Google is the most common search engine). Finally, although some privacy issues exist in using Google Web search data, tracing individuals that conduct online searches when signed into their accounts and recording and analyzing data about users’ characteristics, such as gender and age, intent of web search and “search outcomes” could improve the usefulness of this tool for public health and occupational health education purposes, providing more insights.Concluding RemarksTo our knowledge, this study is the first analysis of big data analytics, including media coverage and web search behaviors related to an occupational disease, namely silicosis, carried out both in quantitative and qualitative terms. Very little is known about the level of scientific engagement, news coverage and web-activities related to this occupational disease and how they influence each other. However, ICTs are playing a major role in nowadays society and both occupational physicians and public health policy-makers should be aware of their potentiality.In the current work, we have shown a renewed interest for silicosis, induced by acute massive clusters and media coverage, produced peaks in search volumes and a marked increase in scientific articles related to this phenomenon. Changes in risk exposures and in the natural history of a disease reflect in changes in search behaviors. These results support adoption of effective preventive and legislative measures which may lead to reduced incidence rate, related scientific production and web activities.As such, novel data streams could be useful in order to assess the reaction of the public engagement to novel occupational risks, unexpected changes in diseases natural history and the effectiveness of preventive workplace practices and legislative measures adopted to improve evidence based occupational health.[14] Further, occupational clinicians can become aware of the most frequently searched topics by patients and proactively address these concerns and doubts during the medical examination. Institutional bodies and organisms should be more present in the new digital tools to disseminate and communicate accurate information about silicosisHowever, this manuscript should be intended as preliminary, exploratory communication, paving the way for further studies.On the other hand, it must be stressed that we did not formally assess the quality and the correctness of the Web content surfed by the users. Further researches carrying out a formal content analysis of the online material concerning silicosis should be performed.Author ContributionsConceptualization: NLB PD.Data curation: NLB.Formal analysis: NLB.Funding acquisition: PD.Investigation: NLB.Methodology: NLB.Project administration: PD.Resources: NLB.Software: NLB.Supervision: PD.Validation: NLB.Visualization: NLB.Writing – original draft: NLB GD PD.Writing – review & editing: AT FB.References1.

It was originally described by Berger and colleagues in 1924 using the term “esthesioneuroepitheliome olfactif” [1]. It represents approximately 3% of malignant sinonasal tumors and the incidence has been estimated at 0.4 per million [2]. The common clinical symptoms are nonspecific sinonasal complaints, including unilateral nasal obstruction, recurrent epistaxis, visual disturbances, headache and others. Kadish and co-workers proposed a classification system of stage A, B, and C based on their experience of 17 cases[3], without consideration of metastasis. To make up for the insufficiency of Kadish stage system, Foote and Morita added stage D (cervical nodal or distant metastasis) to the Kadish classification [4]. In 1992, Dulguerov and Calcetta proposed a tumor, node and metastasis (TNM) staging system, largely based on computed tomography(CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, allowing for cervical lymph node involvement and distant metastasis [5]. These tumors have a tendency towards local invasion (commonly orbit and anterior skull base) and distant metastases (commonly neck, lungs, liver and bones). Patients with ONB are diagnosed definitively by Hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Hyams developed a histopathologic grading system, taking all of the histopathological features into account. While there is controversy and divergency in the treatment modality, it typically involves surgery and radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy[6]. To better understand the clinical features of ONB, We retrospectively analyzed our cases over last ten years to summarize the characteristics and prognostic factors. Additionally, we performed a systematic review of previous published studies to compare our findings with them.Materials and MethodsEthics StatementThis study was conducted under the supervision and approval of the Medical Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Permit Number: 2015–020). These selected patients or their family members in this study have given written informed consents to publish these case details.Patients recruitmentWe performed a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with ONB who were treated in our otolaryngology department from 2000 to 2010. As a result, this study included a cohort of 13 cases, who went to ENT or oncology out-patient department initially and then were transferred to ENT in-patient department to received hospital treatment.Information collectionWe collected detailed clinical data regarding age, gender, TNM stage, modified Kadish stage, Hyams grade and treatment modality individually, and then telephoned the patients or their family members to obtain follow-up data. Pathological slices of all patients were reviewed to summarize the common features of ONB and to confirm the Hyams grade. The clinical therapeutic effect was demonstrated by the contrast of CT or MRI scans before and after treatment.Statistical analysisOverall survival rate was defined as the time from initial treatment to death for whatever reasons and was calculated based on the Kaplan- Meier method, while univariate analysis was carried out by using the log-rank test. A ‘p’ value < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp.).ResultsPatient Demographics and clinical symptomsThirteen patients were recruited in this study, 8 men and 5 women, ranging from 15 to 69 (median 43) years old. The initial clinical symptoms were unilateral nasal obstruction (10/13), epistaxis (6/13), visual disturbance (3/13), headache (2/13) and others. Follow-up was accomplished with all patients, with median duration of 65 months ranging from 23 to 116 months.Distribution of staging and gradingThe classification of the 13 cases with respect to Dulguerov TNM staging, modified Kadish staging and Hyams grading was calculated. As for the TNM staging system, three patients were diagnosed at stage T1, two at stage T2, six at stage T3 and two at stage T4. Moreover, three patients had cervical lymph node metastasis (N1 stage) and two had distant metastasis present (M1 stage). According to the Kadish classification, one patient was at stage A, three were at stage B, six were at stage C and three were at stage D. Within the six patients at stage C, four had invasion of the cribriform plate, one had partial lysis of the anterior skull base and another had a spread into the bone orbit. Moreover, three patients at stage D consisted of three neck lymphatic metastases and two bone metastases. With regard to Hyams grading classification, one patient was at grade Ⅰ, five were at grade Ⅱ and the rest of seven were at grade Ⅲ.Treatment modalityTreatment modality was determined for each patient individually, allowing for suggestion of the surgeon and decision of the patient. The patient at stage A only underwent endoscopic endonasal resection. Seven patients, including two at stage B, four at stage C and one at stage D, received preoperative external beam radiation with 55 Gy to decrease the tumor volume and insure the tumor resectable. Two patients (one at stage B and the other at stage C) had positive microscopic margins and received postoperative external beam radiation with 60 Gy. Three patients who were at stage C or D underwent both radiotherapy of 65Gy and chemotherapy of etoposide and cisplatinum, and two of them also underwent a modified neck dissection for excision of the metastatic cervical lymph nodes. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics and treatment modality are summarized in Table 1.

Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment modality.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166046.t001Imaging featuresLocal extension of the tumor is evaluated using radiological examination. CT scan is the initial radiological choice because of a better display of tumor size and bony erosion (Fig 1). ONB typically shows a relatively homogeneous soft-tissue mass in the nasal cavity, leading to a non-specific radiological appearance. Positron emission tomography (PET) is not a routine evaluation but can be used as an adjunct to CT, clearly showing cervical lymph node metastasis (Fig 1). In order to distinguish tumor tissue from nasal secretions, MRI is also required. ONB appears as low-intense to grey matter on the T1-weighted image and relatively high-intense on the T2-weighted image (Fig 1). CT scan was also adopted in the follow-up study to compare pre-and post-operative effect (Fig 2).

Pre- and post-operative CT scans.Endoscopic surgery released intraorbital compression behind the left eyeball (A1 and A2, red star) and resected tumor mass in left nasal cavity, maxillary and ethmoidal sinus (A2, B1and B2). Elective neck dissection removed those metastatic cervical lymph nodes (C1 and C2, yellow arrows). Those post-operative CT scans were taken after 2 months of surgery.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166046.g002Histopathology characteristicsAll patients were diagnosed as ONB through histopathological analysis of postoperative specimens or the biopsy of lesion. Typical light microscopy features of Hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining were as follows: homogeneous small cells with uniform round nuclei, with rosette or pseudorosette formation, and eosinophilic fibrillary intercellular background material. The neoplastic cells have prominent nuclei, and the cell borders are difficult to see (Fig 3A, 3B and 3C). In the case of difficulty to differentiate ONB from other small cell malignant tumors, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining is very important. As for IHC, Ki-67, neuron specific enolase (NSE), synaptophysin, chromogranin and S-100 protein were often positive to various degrees; while cytokeratin, vimentin and leucocytic common antigen (LCA) were usually negative (Fig 3D, 3E and 3F).

Histopathology characteristics of ONB.H-E staining revealed a nest-like or cord-like tumor mass, showing uniform small cells with prominent round nuclei and eosinophilic fibrillary background (A, ×100). Pseudorosette formation (Homer-Wright rosettes) consisted of a ring of columnar cells and the presence of fibrillary material within the central space (B and C, yellow arrow, ×400). IHC staining for Ki-67 was 60% positive in all neoplastic cells (D, ×100) while staining for NSE was mild positive (E, ×400). LCA (CD45) was negative in ONB tissue but positive in lymphoid tissue (F, ×100). Tumor cells were metastatic into the lymphatic vessel (F, red arrow, ×100).              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166046.g003Prognostic factors associated with Overall SurvivalAll patients had regular follow-ups, with a median duration of 65 months, ranging from 23 to 116 months (Table 1). The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 46.2% (6/13). Patient characteristics–age and gender, tumor features and treatment modalities were evaluated with respect to OS by univariate analysis. Analysis revealed that age (log-rank p = 0.727), gender (log rank p = 0.972) and Hyams grading (log rank p = 0.141) had no effect on OS. However, T stage (log-rank p = 0.028), N stage (log-rank p = 0.000), M stage (log-rank p = 0.007), modified Kadish stage (log-rank p = 0.025), and treatment modality (log-rank p = 0.015) indeed affected OS with statistical differences (Table 2). Survival curves were plotted according to those potential prognostic factors (Fig 4).

Follow-up and overall survival rates (OS).              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166046.t002DiscussionOlfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) is an uncommon malignant neoplasm in nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, with a tendency to invade the bony orbit or anterior skull base. Although Trojanowski JQ demonstrated the presence of neurofilament proteins (NFP) in ONB tissue to reveal its neural origin in 1982[7], the exact origin still remains unclear for lack of direct evidence of the olfactory epithelium[6]. Due to its rarity, it is difficult to summarize the characteristics and prognostic factors of the disease. Age distribution was uniform in this study with a median of 43years old. Song C and colleagues reported a bi-peak incidence at the second and sixth decades of life [8], but majority studies supported a unimodal peak in the fourth and fifth decades of life [9, 10]. To date, no clear aetiological agent has been demonstrated in human beings [6]. In ONB, a complex pattern of gene alterations were described, for instance, gains in 20q and 13q, nevertheless no specific mutations have been reported [11]. Further advances in molecular biology of ONB may help us better understand this disease and predict the prognosis.The initial clinical symptoms of these ONB patients were non-specific compared with chronic rhinosinusitis or other benign nasal tumors. In our study, 76.9% (10/13) had unilateral nasal obstructions, 46.2% (6/13) had repeated epistaxis and 23.1% (3/13) had visual disturbance. Minor manifestations are anosmia, headache, facial pain and epiphora. In the previous literature, the most common symptoms of patients with this tumor may include nasal obstruction, anosmia, epistaxis, and headache [1], which is consistent with the results of this study. Since most of these symptoms are nonspecific, it is difficult to make an early diagnosis which is rather vital to patients’ prognosis. A coronal CT scan is the recommended initial radiological exam and essential for staging [12]. ONB often displays a homogeneous soft-tissue mass in the upper nasal cavity, with various degrees of bony erosion. MRI scans are of value in delineating the tumor mass, presenting a low- intense signal in T1-weighted images and an iso- or high- intense signal in T2-weighted images. In our study, both imaging tests were necessary for all patients. PET-CT acts as a complementary exam, which is useful for the detection of cervical or distinct metastases.The key to early diagnosis of ONB is an early intranasal biopsy. Typical light microscopy features of H-E staining consist of nest-like homogeneous small cells with uniform round nuclei, with rosette or pseudorosette formation, and eosinophilic fibrillary intercellular background material [6], as shown in Fig 3A, 3B and 3C. The neoplastic cells have prominent nuclei, and the cell borders are difficult to see. When the tumor tissue is undifferentiated, showing anaplastic pyknotic cell nucleus and many pathological mitotic figures, it is difficult to distinguish ONB from other small cell malignant tumors, including malignant lymphoma, Ewing tumor, malignant melanoma, and, in particular, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma by light microscopy [13]. In these instances, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining is of great value. There is no specific marker for ONBs, but most of them are positive for neuron specific enolase (NSE), S-100 protein, Ki-67, synaptophysin, chromogranin and neurofilament; while negative for cytokeratin, vimentin and leucocytic common antigen (LCA). S-100 positive cells are usually found at the periphery of the lobules and correspond to sustentacular cells. These same peripheral cells may be positive with glial filament acidic protein (GFAP) [14]. The most commonly used proliferation index is Ki-67.A former study showed that longer survival rates are related significantly to a low (< 10%) Ki-67 labeling index [15], which is consistent with our study. In our thirteen cases, the highest Ki-67 labeling index was 60% (as shown in Fig 3D) and the patient only survived 23 months after treatment with the shortest follow-up.According to the degrees of lobular architecture, mitotic index, nuclear pleomorphism, fibrillary matrix, rosettes or pseudo-rosettes, calcifications and necrosis, Hyams proposed the only histological grading system for ONB in 1988 [14]. Tumors are separated into four grades, ranging from Grade I (well differentiated) to Grade IV (least differentiated). It is complex to use this classification system due to the semi-quantitative nature and some level of discordance among pathologists. Moreover, diagnoses based on biopsies can result in sampling errors [16]. Therefore, many studies tend to divide ONB into low-grade (Hyams Ⅰ/ Ⅱ) and high-grade (Hyams Ⅲ/ Ⅳ). Malouf et al[17] drew a conclusion that patients with high-grade ONB had higher T4 stage, frequent lymph node involvement and mainly leptomeningeal metastasis in contrast to low-grade ONB. Thus, a High-grade of Hyams system portends a worse prognosis [18]. In our study, low-grade had a higher 5-year overall survival of 66.7% compared to high-grade of 28.6%. However, our study showed no statistical difference by log-rank test (P = 0.141), probably due to the small number of sample size.Another widely used classification system is the TNM system proposed by Dulguerov in 1992 [5], based on pre-treatment CT and MRI findings. The detailed description of this system is as follows. T1: Tumor involving the nasal cavity and /or paranasal sinuses (excluding sphenold), sparing the most superior ethmoidal cells; T2: Tumor involving the nasal cavity and /or paranasal sinuses (including sphenold),with extension to or erosion of the cribriform plate; T3:Tumor extending into the orbit or protruding into the anterior cranial fossa; T4:Tumor involving the brain. N0: No cervical lymph node metastasis; N1: Any form of cervical lymph node metastasis. M0: No metastasis; M1: Distant metastases. Bachar G et al. [19] and Zafereo et al. [20] both demonstrated that TNM system was correlated most closely to survival and recurrence compared with Hymas grading and Kadish staging. In this research, the incidence of cervical involvement was 23.1% and distant metastasis was 15.4% at the time of diagnosis, within the range of 10 to 33% and 12 to 25%, reported by Castelnuovo [21]. Our study revealed that TNM staging was an important guide for prognosis. T, N and M stages were related prognostic factors with P = 0.028, 0.000, 0.007 (log-rank test), respectively, in agreement with the previous literature.In addition, modified Kadish staging system is the most accepted staging system, although it was initially described based on 17 patients only. Stage A: Tumor limited to the nasal fossa. Stage B: Tumor extension into the paranasal sinuses. Stage C: Tumor extension beyond the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Stage D: Metastases are identified in cervical lymph nodes or distant sites [3, 4]. 30.8% of patients recruited in our study were at low-stage (A/B) and 69.2% at high-stage (C/D), which showed the difficulty of early diagnosis. High-stages of modified Kadish system ended up with a significantly poorer prognosis compared to low-stage (log-rank P = 0.025), as reported in numerous literatures [8, 9].The optimal treatment of ONB is diversified and controversial. Craniofacial resection has been considered the gold standard surgical treatment for sinonasal tumors. However, it is a radical approach with a high level of mortality and a long recovery time [22]. With the development of endoscopic approaches over the last two decades, many centers are in favor of endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) over traditional open craniofacial surgery for ONB [23]. A meta-analysis in 2012 compared oncologic outcomes between open and endoscopic surgery, then supported the use of endoscopic approaches, citing comparable survival to open approach [24]. Clinical experiences of UCLA revealed that the endoscopic approach had a statistically significant decrease in length of hospital stay and a trend towards reduced blood loss and complications [25]. Lund VJ and colleagues summarized an eighteen-year experience and reported that endoscopic resection is an alternative to conventional craniofacial resection [26]. Based on the favorable results observed so far, the combination of endoscopic sinus surgery and radiotherapy can be considered as a promising new option for the treatment of ONB that is worthy of further investigation [27]. Researchers in Anderson Cancer Center drew a conclusion that survival is improved considerably when surgical resection is followed by postoperative radiation [28]. If the tumor tends to involve the adjacent structures which are important, such as infraorbital canal, optic nerve and optic intersection, researchers recommend intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) instead of conventional radiotherapy because IMRT better preserves closer structures [29]. In addition to surgery and radiotherapy, systemic therapy also includes chemotherapy, which may offer improvement of local control and reduction of the frequency of distant metastasis, especially for patients with unresectable tumors [30].A retrospective review at the Mayo Clinic showed a possible benefit in chemotherapy with a combination of cisplatin and etoposide in high grade tumor [31]. Different institutions reveal that high grade tumors were sensitive to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In this regard, grading has been suggested as an important factor influencing treatment decision in ONB [32]. In our study, 76.9% patients (10/13) underwent comprehensive treatment including EES while 23.1% (3/13) received radiotherapy and chemotherapy without EES. Oncologic outcomes had a significant difference between with- and without-surgery group (log-rank P = 0.015). Our experiences are summarized here. Surgery alone is effective for low-stage tumors with clear margins. Radiotherapy is used for residual lesions and for all high-stage tumors. Tumor shrinkage after neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy can transform the case from inoperable to operable. As for extensive metastatic lesions, systemic chemotherapy and palliative radiation to local site are advised, aiming to improve the quality of life. Moreover, elective cervical dissection is carried out when preopreative examination had confirmed the existence. With regard to dosage of radiotherapy, we adopt 55 Gy before surgery and 60 Gy after surgery. The preferred chemotherapy regimen is cisplatin and etoposide, which is the same as in the Mayo Clinic [33]. It is emphasized in earlier literatures that recurrence can occur years after the completion of treatment, even after the 10-year mark. Therefore, long-term follow-up is needed [34].The present study was subject to certain limitations. It was a retrospective case series from single institution and the number of definite diagnosed patients was limited, which could bias the results. These biases would be addressed in the future through a prospective randomized double-blinded trial. Under the condition of a large enough sample size, it will be necessary for Cox multivariate regression analysis to eliminate confounding factors. Longer follow-up will be needed to ascertain if these findings hold true.ConclusionsPreoperative assessment of clinical manifestations and imaging presentations are essential to determine the treatment plan. Histopathology is rather important for diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Late stages classified by the TNM and Kadish systems indicate poorer prognosis. Comprehensive treatment modality, including endoscopic endonasal surgery achieved good long-term results. Further studies are needed to better define the role and appropriate sequence of comprehensive treatment in ONB.AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to all participants in the study.Author ContributionsConceptualization: GZ MD.Data curation: WZ.Formal analysis: LZ KN.Funding acquisition: JW.Investigation: LZ KZ CX JY.Methodology: LZ KZ CX JY.Project administration: GZ.Resources: LZ KZ CX JY.Software: LZ.Supervision: GZ JW.Writing – original draft: LZ.References1.

The purpose of this study is to describe a clinic cohort of PLWH and examine associations with viral suppression with a focus on drug use and sexual risk behaviors. Study findings can inform prevention efforts to reduce risk behaviors among PLWH with unsuppressed viral load seen in the clinical setting.Substance use is a key factor for high-risk sexual behavior.[3–5] Nationally, 17% of heterosexual women, 16% of men who have sex with men (MSM) and 11% of heterosexual men living with HIV have an unsuppressed viral load concurrent with a sexual or drug use risk behavior.[2] Alcohol and crack or powder cocaine use have been related to multiple concurrent sex partners among heterosexuals and MSM,[6] and heroin use with fewer partners.[7] Inconsistent condom use occurs with alcohol [6, 8, 9] and injection drug use.[10]Limited access to treatment and low adherence to ART may be a consequence of substance use, but for those who do adhere to treatment virologic outcomes are comparable to those who do not use substances.[11] Use of stimulants, including methamphetamine [12] crack [12, 13] and cocaine [12, 14] as well as alcohol [13,15] but not heroin [14] have been associated with poorer adherence to ART compared to persons who do not use substances. Persons who actively inject drugs have had lower rates of viral suppression at ART initiation but not with continued treatment, possibly due to varying intensity of injection over time, including abstinence, as well as linkages with support services that can improve adherence for those engaged in care.[16]MethodsThis is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional sample of 500 PLWH from a study evaluating risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization.[17] Subject recruitment, interviews and chart abstraction occurred between March 2010 and April 2011. The Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board approved the study and consent procedure and all participants provided written informed consent that was recorded on a signed consent form.Study populationThe Baltimore, Maryland, metropolitan area has the third highest prevalence of PLWH in the US.[18] Similar to national trends, the proportion of incident cases is highest in the MSM risk group (50%), followed by heterosexual (37%) and persons who inject drugs (PWID) (10%).[19]The Johns Hopkins University AIDS Service (JHUAS) has two clinics in the Baltimore area. Over 75% of JHUAS clients receive care at the Moore Clinic for HIV at the Johns Hopkins Hospital medical campus in the East Baltimore community. The Moore Clinic provides many co-located ancillary services, including opiate substitution, counseling and mental health care, and medication support. The Moore Clinic follows an average of 2,300 mostly African-American (77%) clients annually, including the uninsured with a majority having HIV transmission risks of intravenous drug use and heterosexual sex. The Green Spring Station (GSS) clinic is located in Baltimore County, serves about 650, primarily white (64%) and exclusively insured clients, with MSM as the key affected population.Eligible participants were current JHUAS clients with two or more visits within the previous 12 months, were 18 years of age and older and able to understand spoken English and provide consent. Clients at each clinic were approached and screened consecutively at a routine or acute care visit unrelated to the study during the recruitment period. Interviewers approached all patients at GSS and every 10th patient entering the Moore Clinic because of its much larger clinic population. A $25 gift card was offered for study participation.Behavioral assessmentStudy team members administered the questionnaire (S1 Appendix) during face-to-face interviews onsite following clients’ appointments with their providers. Fourteen questions developed from previously published studies [20, 21] focused on characterization of sexual and substance use behaviors. Given the sensitive nature of the information, interviews took place in private consultation rooms and it was stressed that all responses were confidential. Interviewers were registered nurses or nursing students trained in use of the tool as well as sexual history taking. The time frame for any sexual or drug use behaviors was the 12 months prior to the interview. Research nurses reviewed patient medical charts to confirm demographic information and obtain medical history and viral load results from the most recent lab visit. Viral suppression was defined as viral load below detectable limits of 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL blood.Statistical analysisThe primary analysis examined associations between participant characteristics and behaviors with having an unsuppressed viral load among those prescribed ART. Given the high prevalence of unsuppressed viral load in the cohort, prevalence ratios were determined through a generalized linear model with log link, Poisson distribution and robust standard errors. Patterns of ART prescription were examined comparing persons prescribed and not prescribed ART in the full cohort. Interactions between drug use and sexual behaviors and both risk behaviors with demographic characteristics were tested. Variables with a significance of p value of 0.05 or less in bivariate analyses were included in multivariable regression models, except for use of individual substances to avoid collinearity given the high levels of poly-substance use. Condom use was retained regardless of statistical significance given its importance to preventing HIV transmission. All tests were two-sided and a p value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. The data analysis was conducted using STATA software version 14 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas, USA).ResultsThere were 500 participants recruited for the study, 150 from GSS and 350 from the Moore Clinic. There were 438 subjects on ART, of which 366 (83.6%) were virally suppressed and 72 (16.4%) were unsuppressed (Table 1). The median viral load was 8,663 (IQR 250–38,380). Individuals with an unsuppressed viral load were more likely than those with a suppressed viral load to be younger (mean age 47.8 vs. 50.9 years; p = 0.009), black compared to other races (79.2% vs. 64.2%; p = 0.014) and earn less than $25,000 annually (88.9% vs. 65.0%; p < 0.001). Among the unsuppressed, sexual risk was lower, with fewer having multiple sex partners in the previous thirty days (39.8% vs. 58.5%; p = 0.003), while substance use was greater, with more using multiple substances (38.9% vs. 24.4%; p = 0.012), excessive alcohol (13.9% vs. 6.0%; p = 0.019) and benzodiazepines (16.7% vs. 8.5%; p = 0.033). Benzodiazepines were the most commonly used substance in combination with others. The unsuppressed were also more likely to be taking opiate substitution therapy (14.1% vs. 6.3%; p = 0.023).

In univariate regression, lower prevalence of an unsuppressed viral load was associated with each year of increasing age (PR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95, 0.99), any college (PR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.77), annual income equal to or over $25,000/year (PR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.56) and with use of benzodiazepines (PR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.93). Greater prevalence of unsuppressed viral load was associated with black race (PR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.24), poly-substance use (PR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.65) and opiate substitution (2.01; 95% CI: 1.14, 3.54). In multivariable regression, only the lower prevalence of being unsuppressed with increasing age (aPR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95, 0.99) and income equal to or over $25,000/year (aPR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.70) remained significant.

Univariate and multivariable regression results for the outcome of having an unsuppressed viral load for those taking ART.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166016.t002Among the full cohort of 500 participants, 62 were not prescribed ART. Patterns of ART prescription revealed greater proportions prescribed ART with any college compared to high school education (92.5% vs. 83.6%; p = 0.003) and with incomes over $25,000/year (92.5% vs. 85.6%; p = 0.031). Prescription of ART was lower among blacks compared to other races (84.6% vs. 94.2%; p = 0.003), persons who use multiple substances (81.3% vs. 90.1%; p = 0.007), injection drugs (65.4% vs. 88.8%; p < 0.001), excessive alcohol (74.4% vs. 88.8%; p = 0.006) and crack cocaine (78.4% vs. 89.8%; p = 0.002), as well as among heterosexuals compared to gay/lesbian/bisexuals (85.2% vs. 92.6%; p = 0.019). The differences between sexual orientation may be related to socioeconomic characteristics, with persons identifying as gay/lesbian/bisexual more likely to have some college education (75.9% vs. 30.5%; p < 0.001) and earn more than $25,000 annually (58.6% vs. 15.4%; p < 0.001).DiscussionWhile sex and drug use behaviors were not associated with an unsuppressed viral load, they did occur in the presence of viremia and consequently represent a risk for transmission. Compared to a nationally representative survey of PLWH receiving outpatient care in the United States,[22] the study population had greater transmission risk behaviors, with more reporting unprotected sex (37.8% vs. 23%), crack cocaine use (38.3% vs. 4.3%), and any non-injection drug (37.6% vs. 26.6%) or intravenous drug use (10.2% vs. 2%). Our study also had fewer with a high school or higher education (45.2% vs. 53.2%) and a greater proportion of black race (69% vs. 41.7%), indicating a more socioeconomically disadvantaged group.Guidelines to initiate ART in treatment naïve patients at the time of the study recommended starting treatment when CD4+ T cell counts declined below 500 cells/mm3 or there was a history of AIDS.[23] In practice, many JHUAS providers were offering ART to all patients, even those with CD4+ T cell levels over 500, and some patients not on ART during the study period had been previously, but did not continue due to low medication adherence. Prior treatment adherence and provider prescribing preferences were not available and consequently it was not possible to distinguish how these factors may have impacted the decision not to treat.It was also found that ART was less likely to be prescribed to persons of black race, having high school or less education and reporting substance use. Abstinence or participation in mental health and substance use treatment services supports adherence [24] and indicates the importance of screening for psychosocial needs and referral to ancillary care. Although substance use was common in this cohort, it was not found to be associated with viral suppression in the adjusted model, suggesting that patients using substances can be adherent and bias against offering treatment due to substance use behaviors should be avoided. With younger age and lower income related to an unsuppressed viral load, adherence counseling should be culturally sensitive and educationally appropriate for youth, and barriers to accessing care such as transportation needs and unstable housing should be addressed.Although just 40% of the 1.2 million PLWH in the U.S. are engaged in care,[1] they represent a substantial opportunity to implement risk reduction interventions given that many are not virally suppressed.[22] Interventions to change drug use and sexual risk behaviors can produce significant and lasting reductions in risk behaviors and improve ART adherence.[25–27] Yet among PLWH receiving regular care, prevention counseling to reduce transmission from sexual and substance use behaviors is provided half or less of the time.[28, 29] With high proportions engaging in high-risk drug use and sexual behaviors, our study confirms the need for these services for PLWH seen in the clinical setting. However, risk behavior(s) or viremia alone are necessary but not individually sufficient for transmission to occur, and consequently must be considered together when evaluating transmission risks.[2, 30]While many HIV specialty clinics provide co-located mental health, drug treatment and other supportive services,[31] low rates of screening, counseling and referrals by clinicians remains a challenge.[28,29] Screening for risk behaviors and providing prevention messages are limited by time constraints and competing clinical priorities even where these interventions are the standard of care for a clinical practice. Additionally, with healthcare reform and the move away from specialty HIV to general primary care clinics, patients face new challenges in navigating the healthcare system to connect with ancillary services.[32]This study has described the characteristics of clients with an unsuppressed viral load and considered patterns of ART prescription. Limitations included the use of self-reported risk behaviors that are subject to social desirability and recall bias. Important factors to consider in future studies include length of time since diagnosis, stage of HIV disease at diagnosis, duration of ART, and HIV or treatment status of stable partners, which were not determined given the degree of missing data for these particular characteristics and inability to confirm reliability of the information that was available.ConclusionA proportion of persons in HIV medical care on ART were not virally suppressed and continued to participate in transmission risk behaviors, indicating the need for screening, prevention counseling and access to ancillary services, particularly for substance use and safer sex counseling. Substance use itself was not a risk factor for unsuppressed viral load, indicating persons actively using can be adherent to treatment.Supporting InformationS1 Appendix.

Within such frameworks, guideline recommendations on optimal care are linked to performance measures and accountability processes. Performance measures assess to what extent care is delivered according to guideline recommendations. When applying such measures in clinical practice, variation in the performance of healthcare providers and institutions is common. For example, prescribing of preferred drugs by Dutch general practitioners ranged from 35% to 95%, whereas prescribing drug treatment when indicated ranged from 60% to 95% [1]. Differences in performance may be attributed to the underlying patient population as well as to the healthcare provider and the practice organization.In heterogeneous populations, it is to be expected that healthcare provider’s treatment decisions are influenced by differences in patient characteristics. For example, patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) commonly have multiple conditions and risk factors which may require individualized treatment plans. A recent review concluded that patient characteristics, such as marital status and BMI, affect outcome measures for diabetes but no consistent patterns were observed for process measures [2]. Previous research indicates that patient characteristics, such as age [3, 4], gender [5, 6], disease duration [7], comorbidity presence [8], and level of risk factor control [9, 10], can all influence prescribing in this population. This may reflect appropriate care, for example, when different treatment regimens are considered for elderly patients [11, 12], or intensified treatment is prescribed for patients with more progressed disease states [13]. Variance may also be justifiable when there are competing demands [14, 15] or when patients are reluctant or unwilling to take specific or more drugs [16]. In other cases, variance can be non-justifiable, for example, when prescription rates for guideline recommended treatment differ in men and women [5, 6]. Healthcare providers’ personal preferences, knowledge and habits can influence treatment decisions. For example, physicians may differ in their preferences for certain types of treatment, or in their reluctance or keenness to prescribe [10, 17, 18]. In addition, practice characteristics, such as practice type, size, consultation time, and the presence of support staff have been found to influence prescribing behavior [19, 20]. These factors may contribute to non-justifiable variance between practices. Accounting for patient characteristics causing justifiable differences is important for fair between practice comparisons of treatment quality. The aim of this study is to describe the differences in treatment quality of patients with diabetes between general practices, and identify patient and practice level characteristics that may explain these differences.MethodsStudy design and settingWe conducted a cross-sectional study to assess treatment quality in 2012 in a large diabetes care group in The Netherlands, which included more than 80% of all general practices in the province of Groningen. Diabetes care groups have been formed after the introduction of bundled payment in 2007 [21]. They are responsible for the organization and provision of diabetes care in accordance with the Dutch clinical practice guidelines.Study population and data collectionData were collected from the GIANTT (Groningen Initiative to Analyze Type 2 Diabetes) database. This regional longitudinal database contains anonymized data extracted from electronic medical records of almost all type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients (<1% opted out) managed in general practice [22]. The database includes prescription data, medical history, results from routine laboratory tests and physical examinations. Medical history consists of diagnoses, which are documented in the medical records by means of the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) or short text descriptions which are manually coded. From the 189 general practices in GIANTT, 6 were excluded for having incomplete prescription or diagnostic data. Patients diagnosed with T2DM before 1 January 2012 were selected. Patients with incomplete follow-up in 2012, and patients with missing or invalid onset dates for diabetes were excluded.Outcomes: treatment measuresTreatment quality was defined as current treatment status, that is, if a patient was treated or not with guideline recommended drug treatment, similar to many of the prescribing measures currently in use in The Netherlands [23]. We focused on whether any drug treatment was prescribed for eligible patients, and whether the first-choice drug class was prescribed for three common risk factors. This includes treatment in T2DM patients with (1) any glucose-lowering drug, (2) any lipid-lowering drug in patients with an additional diagnosis of dyslipidemia, vascular comorbidity or nephropathy, and (3) any blood pressure-lowering drugs in patients with an additional diagnosis of hypertension, vascular comorbidity or nephropathy. In the Netherlands, general practitioners may prescribe any drug to treat a specific risk factor or indication that is allowed on the Dutch market, but some drugs may have restrictions for reimbursement. Any glucose-lowering treatment included: metformin, sulfonylureas, acarbose, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-inhibitors, insulins, and other blood glucose–lowering drugs (e.g. exenatide, dapagliflozin). Any lipid-lowering treatment included: statins, fibrates, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid and derivatives, and other lipid-modifying drugs (e.g. ezitimibe). Any blood pressure-lowering treatment included: centrally acting antihypertensives, diuretics, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and drugs acting on the renin–angiotensin system. Within the above defined patients the first choice drug classes recommended by Dutch guideline for diabetes care [24] comprised of treatment with (1) metformin, (2) statins, and (3) drugs acting on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS-blockers). A patient was considered as being treated when a prescription was recorded within the last 4 months of 2012, taking into account that a prescription can be issued for a maximum period of 3 months in the Netherlands.Explanatory variablesTo explain the differences in treatment between practices, the following patient level characteristics were included as dichotomous variables: age (≥70 years for glucose lowering treatment, ≥80 years for blood pressure and lipid lowering treatment), gender, duration of diabetes (≥2 years), overweight (ICPC-1 codes: T82, T83), history of cardiovascular comorbidity (ICPC-1 codes: K74-K77, K84, K99.1, left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty), history of peripheral vascular comorbidity (ICPC-1 codes: K89-K92, peripheral bypass, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty), diabetes complications (ICPC-1 codes: K99.6, F83, N94.2), nephropathy (ICPC-1 codes: U90, U99.1, U99.2, U99.3, dialysis, or kidney transplantation), history of malignancy (ICPC-1 codes: A79, B72-B74, D74-D77, F74.1, H75.1, K72.1, L71.1, N74, R84, R85, S77, T71, U75-U77, X75-X77, Y77, Y78), history of psychological disorders (ICPC-1 codes: P70-P80, P85, P98, P99), treatment with 5 or more other chronic drug classes (ATC codes starting with A, B, C, H, L, M, N, R, excluding antihypertensive, glucose-regulating, and lipid-regulating drugs), treatment with 3 or more glucose lowering drug classes, treatment with 4 or more blood pressure lowering drug classes, and treatment with 2 or more lipid lowering drug classes. The cutoff levels for age were based on the Dutch guideline [24] where less stringent treatment targets are recommended for elderly patients. The cutoff level for diabetes duration was chosen to distinguish patients who were recently diagnosed with T2DM (diabetes duration < 2 years) from those having diabetes for a longer period (≥ 2 years). The cutoff levels for the number of chronic medications and numbers of glucose, blood pressure, and lipid lowering medication were chosen to indicate the burden of being on high numbers of drug classes unrelated to the outcome of interest (e.g. the variable determining treatment with 3 or more glucose lowering drug classes was not used in the models where outcome was defined as treatment with glucose-lowering drugs or metformin). The following general practice level characteristics were included in order to explain potentially non-justifiable differences in treatment between practices: number of diabetes patients per practice, presence of educated diabetes assistant, and practice type (solo or group).Statistical analysisThe treatment quality rates were described at practice level as mean percentages with standard deviation, or median percentages with interquartile ranges. Descriptive statistics were also used to describe the distribution of patient characteristics across general practices.Multilevel logistic regression analysis was conducted for each of the six treatment measures separately (using Stata 14.1, Special Edition) to assess the variance that is attributed to general practice level and the part of this variance that can be explained by patient and practice characteristics. Two level random intercept models were estimated with patients at level 1 nested within general practices at level 2. In these models the probability for the treatment outcome can vary across practices but the effect of the patient characteristics is assumed to be the same (fixed) for all practices.First, the variance in treatment at practice level was estimated in an empty multilevel model. Second, multilevel univariate analyses were conducted for each patient and practice level explanatory variable. Next, three multivariate models were built using backwards selection for including variables that were potentially associated with the treatment measure (p<0.2); (i) model 1, with patient level characteristics only, (ii) model 2, with general practice characteristics only, (iii) model 3, with patient and practice characteristics together.The pseudo R2 measure was used to estimate what part of the variance at practice level could be explained by including patient and general practice characteristics [25, 26]. For this, the percentages reduction in pseudo R2 were calculated for each model compared to the empty model, expressing the part of the practice level variance that can be explained by the included characteristics.Ethics statementIn The Netherlands, according to the Code of Conduct for the use of data in Health Research (‘Gedragscode gezondheidsonderzoek’ approved in 2004 by the Dutch College for Protection of Personal Data, taking into account Article 25 of the Dutch Act on the Protection of Personal Data), no ethics committee approval was needed for this research using data from anonymous medical records.ResultA cohort of 24,628 patients with T2DM managed in 183 general practices was eligible, after excluding 974 patients for incomplete follow-up and 27 patients for missing or invalid diabetes onset dates. Of the 183 general practices, 90.7% had a diabetes assistant and 45.4% were practices with a single general practitioner (Table 1). The median number of T2DM patients per practice was 122 with a range from 15 to 480 patients. The proportion of patients with comorbidity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and overweight, varied widely across the practices. Among the eligible patients, 75.3% of patients were treated with glucose-lowering drugs, 73.7% with lipid-lowering drugs, and 87.8% with blood pressure-lowering drugs. Considerable differences (IQR 9.5–13.9) were observed in these treatment rates between general practices (Table 2). The between practice variance in the empty multilevel model was 7.5% for glucose-lowering treatment, 3.6% for metformin, 3.1% for lipid-lowering treatment, 10.3% for statins, 8.6% for blood pressure-lowering treatment, and 3.9% for RAAS-blockers (Table 3). The models including all the characteristics (model 3) are presented in Table 4 reflecting the effect sizes of the associations between the included characteristics and treatment outcomes.

Each of the tested patient characteristics explained less than 2% of the variance in the univariate analyses (S1 Appendix). Together, patient characteristics explained only 3.3% of the variance. Practice characteristics, in turn, explained 15.5% of the variance. For metformin, adjusting for patient characteristics reduced the practice level variance with 0.3% thereby explaining 7.5% of the variance in treatment. In the univariate analyses age of patient and use of ≥5 chronic drugs were the characteristics that explained the most of the practice level variance. Practice characteristics did not explain any practice level variance in treatment with metformin.For lipid-lowering drugs and statins, patient and practice characteristics together reduced the practice level variance with 0.6% each, and thereby explained 20% and 6% of this variance respectively (Table 3). Age, treatment with 3 or more glucose-lowering drugs, and number of patients with T2DM per practice explained between 2.9% and 5.8% of the variance in treatment with lipid-lowering drugs in the univariate analyses (S1 Appendix). Together, patient characteristics explained 9.9% of the variance in treatment with lipid-lowering drugs and 0.3% of the variance in treatment with statins. Practice characteristics explained 8.3% and 6.0% of the variance respectively.For blood pressure-lowering drugs and RAAS-blockers, patient and practice characteristics together reduced the practice level variance with 2.1% and 0.5% respectively, and thereby explained 9.9% and 13.4% of this variance (Table 3). A history of psychological comorbidity and number of T2DM patients per practice explained 3.7% and 4.3% of the variance in treatment with blood pressure-lowering drugs in the univariate analysis (S1 Appendix). Together, patient characteristics explained 6.2% of the variance in treatment with blood pressure-lowering drugs and 7.2% of the variance in treatment with RAAS-blockers. Practice characteristics explained 4.3% and 5.9% of the variance.DiscussionWe observed considerable between practice differences in treatment with glucose-lowering, lipid-lowering, blood pressure-lowering drugs, and RAAS-blockers (IQR ranges of 10% or more) in T2DM patients. Smaller between practice differences in treatment were observed in treatment with metformin and statins (IQR ranges less than 8%). Not more than 10% of the observed differences, however, could be attributed to practice level, indicating that a significant part of the differences may be due to patient-level differences or random variance. Of these differences attributed to practice level, between 6% and 25% could be explained by the patient and practice level characteristics included in our study. Patient characteristics explained almost 10% of the differences in lipid-lowering treatment compared to less than 10% for the other treatments. Practice characteristics explained more than 15% of the differences in glucose-lowering treatment compared to less than 10% for the other treatments.Several studies have described differences in treatment rates between general practices, showing sometimes wide ranges [27–31]. One study looked at between practice differences in treatment with glucose-lowering drugs in Danish patients, and found a two-fold difference in prescription rate between the 10 and 90 percentile [28] compared to a 1.4-fold difference in this study when calculated for these percentiles (data not shown). Another study looked at the differences in treatment with lipid-lowering and blood pressure-lowering drugs in the UK patients with diabetes and hypertension [27]. This study found the IQRs for treatment with lipid-lowering drugs of 11 and for blood pressure-lowering drugs of 8, which are slightly smaller in comparison to the IQRs of around 13 and almost 9 observed in our study. It thus appears that the practice variation we observed among Dutch general practices is lower for glucose-lowering drugs and similar for blood pressure-lowering drugs to that observed previously in other countries. The small between practice differences for treatment with metformin and statins may in part be due to restrictions on the reimbursement of some of the novel drugs, such as DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists and ezetimibe.A recent review looking at patient characteristics associated with diabetes performance indicators did not find any consistent impact of demographics, complications, comorbidity, geography or care-seeking behavior [2]. They however included only studies addressing monitoring of risk factors, for which there may be few justified reasons not to conduct such monitoring. For prescribing treatment, we found that patient characteristics altogether explained at least 10% of the between practices differences for treatment with lipid-lowering drugs, but less than 10% for the treatment with blood pressure-lowering drugs and glucose-lowering drugs. For differences in treatment with lipid-lowering drugs but also with metformin, the patients’ age was relevant, implying that age of a patient influences the practitioners’ decisions to prescribe [32]. Since age-based prescribing in this case may be considered justified [33–35], this supports an age-stratified assessment of these treatment rates. For treatment with lipid-lowering drugs, the concomitant use of 3 or more glucose-regulating drugs explained 3% of the between practice variance. This suggests that there is a higher probability of receiving lipid-lowering drugs in patients with more severe diabetes. Since poor metabolic control is seen as an additional risk factor, starting statins is usually justified in such patients [24]. For metformin the concomitant use of 5 or more chronic drugs explained almost 7% of the variance. There seemed to be a shift from metformin to alternative treatment, including insulin, in patients with polypharmacy. This could be due to more complications and intolerability issues in these patients. On the other hand, the comorbidities and diabetes complications included in this study could not explain the between practice differences. These findings imply that the role of comedication and comorbidity in explaining between practice variance should be further investigated. Especially, more information is needed about other factors, such as disease severity, drug intolerance and medication adherence.Practice characteristics explained at least 15% of the between practices differences for treatment with glucose-lowering drugs, and less than 10% for treatment with lipid-lowering and blood pressure-lowering drugs. Between practice differences in health care quality of patients with diabetes and the role of patient and practice characteristics in these differences were examined previously [36–38]. These studies, however, focused mainly on differences in monitoring of risk factors or differences in risk factor outcomes between practices. Similar to the findings of our study, they showed that the relatively small proportion (1–12%) of differences in quality of care can be attributed to differences between practitioners or practices [2, 36–38]. The number of T2DM patients per practice was the most relevant practice characteristic in our study, especially for receiving any treatment (yes/no). It explained between 5% and 13% of the treatment variance for glucose-lowering drugs, lipid-lowering drugs, blood pressure-lowering drugs, and RAAS-blockers. We observed a lower probability of being treated in practices with a higher number of T2DM patients. One explanation could be that these practices are more active in screening for diabetes, and therefore have more patients not yet in need of treatment [39, 40]. An alternative explanation is that the practice organization in large practices may be insufficient to provide optimal care. Although there is some evidence that practice size may negatively influence quality of care, this finding is not consistent [41]. Of the other practice characteristics, the presence of a physician’s assistant explained some additional variance in treatment with statins where it seemed that statins as a first-choice drug are more prescribed in practices with an assistant. This is in line with a finding in the UK, where prescribing of lipid lowering drugs was more guideline concordant in patients assessed by a project nurse [42]. Surprisingly, we observed a lower probability of being treated with glucose-lowering drugs in practices employing physician’s assistant. One explanation could be that the physicians’ assistants are more consistent with guidelines resulting in a higher number of newly diagnosed patients with T2DM per practice that may receive lifestyle advice first [40]. Overall, it appears that such general practice characteristics can only in part explain differences in treatment rates.The primary care system organization in the Netherlands is comparable with other West-European countries [43]. The population of GIANTT cohort consists mainly of individuals of West-European origin and is comparable with the populations of type 2 diabetes patients from other regions of the Netherlands [3]. Around 12% of patients that were managed by a specialist for their diabetes were excluded from the analysis, since the primary aim of the study was to describe the differences in treatment quality of patients with diabetes between general practices. The study was based on data from the large general practice database containing a wide range of patient characteristics, treatment and comorbidity data. More than 90% of the differences in treatment between practices, however, cannot be explained at practice level. Part of this might be caused by the variance in other patient and practice level characteristics that we were not able to include in our study, e.g. intolerance or unwillingness of patients for taking specific or additional drug treatment, severity of disease, visit frequency or practice location [44]. Because of the cross-sectional design, we could not include the level of HbA1c, cholesterol, or blood pressure in the models. Instead we restricted all models to patients with an indication for treatment (e.g. diagnosis of hypertension or dyslipidemia). The comorbidity data in medical records are known to be incomplete [45], which would result in underestimating their influence on between practice variance. However, the comorbidity data in our study were enriched by manually coding text descriptions, resulting in higher comorbidity rates compared with that observed in a previous general practice study conducted in The Netherlands [46]. Moreover, practices with poor registration levels were excluded from our analysis. Finally, no data were available on practitioner level characteristics, such the physician’s knowledge or attitudes. Given the observed variance at practice level, there is a need to explore other, unmeasured practice or practitioner characteristics [44, 47].Measuring the quality of treatment at practice level is part of various quality improvement initiatives [48–50]. In several countries external parties, such as insurance companies or professional organizations, use quality assessment to reward health care providers who meet predefined standards of quality. For fair assessment it is important to know whether the observed differences in quality of treatment between healthcare providers may be attributed to practice level, and to what extent they can be explained by differences in the underlying patient population. In such cases, either case-mix adjustment or stratification can be recommended [2]. The findings of our study imply that the between practice differences in tested treatment measures are only to a small degree affected by differences in the underlying patient population. Our study only supports to include age as a relevant patient characteristic to reduce justifiable differences in treatment rates, especially with lipid-lowering drugs. Other patient characteristics either do not explain the between practice difference in treatment or do not justify these differences. Of practice characteristics, we found that the number of T2DM patients per practice and presence of a physician’s assistant may explain between practice differences in treatment rates. This and also other modifiable practice characteristics should be identified and explored in future studies.Supporting InformationS1 Appendix.

Most of them form simple trefoil knots, but there are also proteins forming more complex knots such as figure-of-eight, pretzel-like pentaknot and Stevedore’s knot [1, 4–6]. It should be stressed here that these knots are not results of some accidental entanglements of long polypeptide chains but their complex structure and topology is entirely dictated by their sequence [7, 8]. However, folding of knotted proteins is much slower and thus less efficient than of unknotted analogues [7–9]. In that respect, the requirement to form a knot during folding provides evolutionary disadvantage. Yet, several known families of knotted proteins have their knotted domains strongly conserved even in lines of organisms that got separated more than over a billion years ago [10].We investigate here what can be the structural and functional advantage of tightly knotted protein folds that have made them conserved during evolution. We specifically check whether portions of polypeptide chains directly involved in knot formation have gained some special properties. We observed that amino acids positioned at the borders of knotted cores show strongly increased number of contacts giving them the possibility to form various chemical bonds. Borders of the knotted cores showed also increased thermal stability and decreased solvent accessibility. We also look more closely at how the knotted core contributes to the formation of catalytic centres and binding sites for substrates and cofactors. In addition, we compare structural properties of two very similar in structure and function protein homologs where one is knotted and the other unknotted.ResultsIn our search of functional advantages of knots, we concentrate on proteins forming trefoil knots as these are the most frequently observed among knotted proteins. Analysis of the geometry of protein knots leads to the definition of knotted core and knot tails [10–12]. The knotted core is the smallest subchain of the entire polypeptide chain, which still forms the knot, while the tails are the parts of the chain remaining on both sides of the knotted core (see Fig 1). Searching for possible functional advantages of knots in proteins, we focus on deeply knotted proteins, since these are especially difficult to fold [13] and hence their formation my result in possibly unique properties. As deeply knotted proteins we consider those, in which the shortest knot tail is at least 20 amino acids long. In addition, we concentrate on tight knots. Since the smallest knotted core found in KnotProt database [3] consists of 42 amino acids, we set a limit of 84 amino acids (twice the minimal size) on the core size. Finally, to increase the chance of finding structural characteristics caused by knotting and not by some possible structural similarities of compared proteins, that are unrelated to knotting, we decided to analyse only the knotted proteins which are very different from each other, when comparing their structure and function. As a result, we study here three knotted proteins: a methyltransferase from the SPOUT superfamily, N-acetyl-ornithine transcarbamoylase, and a ribonucleoprotein participating in RNA splicing. Our choice is consistent with previous classification of knotted proteins showing that there are 7 different protein families containing a 31 knot, but only three of them possess a deep, tight knot [14].

Violet beads indicate the positions of amino acids participating in the SAH binding (cyan lines). c. SAH bound to the “highlighted” residues within the knotted core. d. Leu78, located in the knotted core entry and which is one of the amino acids contributing to SAH binding site, shows large number of contacts connecting it with the encircling polypeptide chain. e. Ile122, which is located immediately after the exit point from the knotted core also shows a large number of contacts with the encircling polypeptide chain (orange stripes). This number is not as high though as that of the preceding amino acid that is located at the exit point from the core (cyan stripes).              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165986.g001Knotted core and active sites in TrmL proteinSPOUT is a large protein superfamily of rRNA or tRNA-modifying methyltransferases [15, 16]. These proteins form dimers important for activity [17] and each monomer forms a deep trefoil knot providing binding site for the cofactor of the methyl transfer reaction—S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). For SPOUT family members it was shown that amino acids located at the border of the knotted core show high conservation [18, 19]. Relatively recently one of SPOUT members, TrmL, which is a tRNA methyltransferase from E. coli was crystallized without (PDB id 4JAK) and with (PDB id 4JAL) S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) [20]–by-product arising when SAM already “donated” its methyl group to tRNA. The analysis of the crystal where TrmL binds SAH allows determination of the exact amino acids involved in ligand binding. It is interesting to check, whether these are located within or in the immediate vicinity of the knotted core of the protein.Fig 1a shows the structure of TrmL protein (to facilitate perception of the polypeptide structure only one of two monomers of crystalized TrmL dimer is shown) together with a matrix representation that encodes the knotting of all subchains of the analysed protein [11, 21]. All subchains, whose starting and ending residues, indicated along the abscissa and ordinate, respectively, fall within the green rectangle can be considered as forming an open trefoil knot. Therefore, the knotted core of TrmL starts around the Leu78 residue and ends around the Thr121 residue, as indicated in the KnotProt database [3]. The extent of the knotted core is depicted on the matrix diagonal that corresponds to the linear map of the entire protein. It should be mentioned though that defining the borders of the knotted core is somewhat problematic as the borders can vary depending on the algorithm used to detect and define knots [22–24]. The main source of variance between different algorithms is the chosen closing procedure needed to characterize the knot type. Our probabilistic algorithm, implemented in KnotProt database [3], averages over a large number of randomly chosen closing directions and by this is independent of the arbitrary choice of the chain closure. In Fig 1 the violet beads placed on the structure of TrmL protein indicate positions of 4 residues that according to PDB entry 4JAL bind SAH. The positions of these 4 residues are also placed along the diagonal of the matrix. It is visible that two of these 4 residues locate at the extremities of the knotted core, with the next one locating in the core centre. Fig 1b and 1c focus on the knotted core and its immediate vicinity. Fig 1b schematically shows the open 31 knot formed by the corresponding portion of the TrmL chain as well as the approximate positions of the 4 residues binding SAH. Fig 1c shows the actual structure of the corresponding portion of the protein together with the bound SAH molecule. The 31 knot is visible, although its recognition may not be obvious since the polypeptide chain does not form a minimal crossing representation of the 31 knot.In addition to pinpointing the position of the knotted core, the matrix presented in Fig 1a indicates all intra-chain contacts defined as in [25] and marked as red squares. The non-local contacts stabilize formed knots and may also be responsible for the conservation of the knotted character of this protein during evolution. Hence, we focused on the contacts between amino acids that are distally located from each other along the polypeptide chain. Therefore, we imposed the condition that the sequential distance separating the contacts should be at least of 4 amino acids. We were especially interested in contacts between residues located within the knotted core or in its immediate vicinity. Particularly interesting are clusters of contacts that correspond to the regions where the chain enters or exits the knotted core. The horizontal and diagonal lines on the matrix formed by red marks clearly show that the terminal portions of knotted core form a large number of contacts. Fig 1d and 1e show these interactions for individual residues that are located at the N- and C-terminal end of the knotted core, respectively. It is visible that a large number of contacts realizable by individual amino acids are correlated with the particular architectonic motive of tightly knotted proteins where portions of their polypeptide chain are encircled in a nearly perpendicular way by other portions of the same chain forming the knotted core. It is striking that one of the 4 amino acids contributing to the active site of TrmL is exactly the amino acid at the entry to the knotted core and thus forming very extensive set of contacts. Moreover, the second active residue located just outside the knotted core also shows increased number of interactions, although this number is smaller than that of the neighbouring amino acid delimiting the knotted core (see Fig 1e). We would like to stress here that the algorithm that defines borders of knotted cores was described earlier using strict mathematical considerations for curves in space [10] and its detection of knots’ borders in proteins is absolutely independent of the number of contacts in these regions. In addition, the positions of the boundaries, determined with single residue resolution, are as listed in KnotProt [3]. Also other published methods of determining the borders of the knotted cores [22–24] gave very consistent results (See S1 File).The increased number of contacts involving two regions where the polypeptide chain enters and leaves the knotted core (Fig 1a, 1d and 1e), inspired us to check how the number of intra-chain contacts per residue varies along the polypeptide chain of TrmL. Fig 2a shows that both borders of the knotted core form strong local maxima in the total number of contacts formed. In addition, these maxima are broad i.e. there are several sequentially close amino acids which form a large number of contacts. A similar high and broad maximum of contacts is also observed in the centre of the knotted core. Interestingly, each of these three broad maxima of contacts in the borders and in the centre of the knotted core “hosted” one of the four amino acids binding SAH. We should however point out, that these maxima are not strictly global. Though, when considering only short and buried long-distance contacts (i.e. excluding water mediated contacts), these maxima exceed all the others (data not shown).

The number of contacts, relative thermal motion (B-factor) and solvent accessibility (SASA) of TrmL protein.a. The number of contacts in the TrmL polypeptide chain shows strong and broad maxima at the borders and in the centre of the knotted core. Out of the four amino acids involved in SAH binding the three of them locate in these three maxima of contacts. b. B-factor shows strong local minima at the borders and in the centre of the knotted core. Three out of four residues involved in SAH binding are located at or in the immediate vicinity of these sites. c. SASA shows strong local minima at the borders and in the centre of the knotted core. The SASA values are presented as running averages over a window of 8 residues. The gradient colour (horizontal axes) corresponds to colouring of the protein in the Fig 1a, the binding residues are marked by violet beads and dashed lines, and the knot core is delimited by green lines.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165986.g002Next, we investigated whether these three maxima of contacts provide increased stability to the borders as well to the centre of the knotted core as compared to the rest of the protein. Fig 2b shows the B-factor profile (the measure of atoms mobility) obtained for the crystallized protein. It is well visible that these three maxima with many contacts correspond to the regions that show increased stability. The stabilization of knotted cores was proposed earlier as a possible functional advantage of knotted proteins [1, 26–29]. Our analysis revealed though that this stabilization is strongly pronounced at the borders and the centre of the knotted core. As shown in Fig 1d and 1e these regions show many stabilizing interactions that are correlated with the fact that in tight knots there are tight clasps where one segment is locally encircled by the other. It is tempting to speculate that evolutionary conservation of knotted proteins is connected with the specific properties provided by the clasp motifs where one polypeptide chain turns around another chain in a nearly perpendicular orientation [30].Finally, we analysed the solvent accessibility (SASA) of all residues in the functional dimeric, apo form of the protein (see Fig 2c). As could be intuitively expected the exit/entry regions into the knotted core form strong local minima in the solvent accessibility. Interestingly, these low accessibility regions are in the immediate vicinity of two regions that are highly accessible to the solvent and are located just outside of the knotted core. Considering now the solvent accessibility of the four amino acids that contribute to the SAH binding site we can see that the three of them that are located in the centre and in the extremities of the knotted core show very low solvent accessibility. Low solvent accessibility of these sites is required for the formation of hydrophobic pockets that are needed to bind S-adenosylmethionine [31]. On the other hand, the neighbouring regions should be solvent accessible to allow even hydrophobic solutes to approach. The fourth SAH binding amino acid is already outside of the knotted core and as such shows a high solvent accessibility, a high B-factor and a low number of contacts (see Fig 2).Our results indicate that active sites in deeply knotted TrmL proteins locate within their knotted cores in such regions that have somewhat extreme properties caused by knotting. These properties are: large number of contacts with other parts of the chain, specific restriction of thermal fluctuation and high screening from solvent inside the knotted core. On the other hand, these residues have nearby regions that are highly exposed to solvent by being located just outside of the knotted core.Knotted core and active sites in AOTCasesTo check, whether other deeply knotted proteins show similar properties, we analysed N-acetyl-L-ornithine transcarbamoylase (AOTCase, PDB id 3KZN) [32], which is required for biosynthesis of arginine in several species of eubacteria. This protein was crystalized with its natural substrate acetylornithine, which permitted to determine amino acids involved in ligand binding. Fig 3a shows the matrix encoding the position of the knotted core and intra-chain contacts in the AOTCase. Along the diagonal of the matrix we indicated the location of the three amino acids involved in acetylornithine binding as well as the extent of the knotted core. It is well visible that one of the three amino acids binding acetylornithine is located at the border of the knotted core. Looking on the contact map one may again notice many contacts within the knotted core including direct interactions between the regions where the polypeptide chain enters and exits the core. Fig 3a shows a schematic presentation of the knotted portion of the protein forming a right-handed 31 knot and indicates also approximate positions of the three amino acids that bind N-acetylornithine. A detailed structure of the entire protein is shown in Fig 3b.

Here, due to high number of residues the running average over a window of 3 residues is depicted. d, e. B-factor and SASA plots show increased stability and decreased solvent accessibility of the substrate-binding and knot delimiting residues. The gradient colour (horizontal axes) corresponds to colouring of the protein in the Fig 3b, the binding residues are marked by violet beads and dashed lines, and the knot core is delimited by green lines.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165986.g003In Fig 3c the number of contacts per residue of the AOTCase is analysed. One can see that similarly to the TrmL protein, AOTCase shows strong local maxima in the number of contacts at both borders of the knotted core. Interestingly, the three amino acids involved in acetylornithine binding are all in the regions with local maxima of contacts and one of them (as already mentioned) localizes exactly at the border of the knotted core. Fig 3d and 3e show that both the B-factor and SASA feature strong local minima at both borders and in the centre of the knotted core. Interestingly, the two other amino acids that bind acetylornithine and which are located outside of the knotted core are also in the regions with local minima of B-factor and SASA.Knotted core and active sites in Rds3p proteinOur next analysed protein that forms a deep trefoil was the splicing factor Rds3p (PDB id 2K0A) characterized by NMR [33]. This protein contains 3 zinc finger motifs where each contains four cysteines involved in coordinating a zinc ion that stabilizes each domain. Fig 4a shows the matrix identifying the position of the knotted core as well as the intra-chain contacts within the Rds3p protein. It is well visible that amino acids at both borders of the knotted core show numerous contacts with other residues of the knotted core, including direct contact between the two borders. The schematic drawing in Fig 4a shows the formed left-handed 31 knot together with approximate positions of 8 cysteines coordinating zinc ions. This drawing also shows that 8 out of 12 cysteines coordinating 3 zinc ions are located within the knotted core (with one immediately adjacent to the entry into the core) and two additional cysteines are located just outside of the knotted core. Fig 4b shows the detailed structure of the Rds3p protein with its 3 coordinated zinc ions.

Total number of contacts shows that knot delimiting and most of binding residues are characterized by local maxima of contact number. 8 out of 12 binding residues locate inside the knotted core, two more in its exact vicinity. d, e. Thermal fluctuation of the residues and SASA plots show increased stability and decreased solvent accessibility of the ion-binding and knot delimiting residues. As Rds3p was analysed by NMR, instead of B-factor, the mean square displacement is depicted. The binding residues are marked by violet dots and dashed lines, and the knot core is delimited by green lines.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165986.g004Fig 4c, 4d and 4e show that similarly to the TrmL and the AOTCase, analysed earlier, Rds3p protein also shows strong local maxima of contacts in the regions corresponding to the two borders of the knotted core (Fig 4c) and that these two border regions form strong local minima of thermal fluctuation (Fig 4d) as well as of solvent accessibility (Fig 4e). In case of Rds3p protein the cysteines coordinating zinc ions can be considered as forming active sites of this protein. Each of three zinc ions is coordinated by four cysteines. Fig 4c, 4d and 4e show that at least two cysteines of every four localize in one of the regions with large number of contacts, small thermal fluctuations and low solvent accessibility. The majority of these regions localize within the knotted core or in the border regions of the core.Comparison between knotted and unknotted homologous proteinsWe observed that in tightly knotted proteins the borders of their knotted cores are enriched in intra-chain contacts and active sites. However, formation of regions with high number of intra-chain contacts is unlikely to be limited to knotted proteins only. In fact, very similar biochemical reactions can be performed by knotted and unknotted proteins. This is the case of tRNA methyltransferases, where in addition to knotted proteins (such as TrmL protein discussed earlier) there are also unknotted proteins that show no homology to knotted methyltransferases and in which the catalytic domains form the Rossmann folds (e.g. FTSJ RNA methyltrasferase) [15]. Probably the best example of proteins with very similar structure and function, which differ with respect to knotting, is provided by two classes of transcarbamoylases: knotted AOTCases (described previously) and unknotted OTCases. These two classes of enzymes transfer carbamoyl group from carbamoylphosphate to N-acetyl-ornithine or ornithine, respectively. Both enzymes have very similar, nearly superimposable structures (Fig 5a). The crucial difference is in the vicinity of the active region where one short polypeptide section passes either on one, or another side of other short section, introducing or removing one essential crossing of the trefoil knot (Fig 5b). That local rearrangement does not change significantly the number of contacts in the relevant protein regions. Fig 5c, 5d and 5e show that substrate binding sites in unknotted OTCase with PDB code 4JQO have very similar characteristics to substrate binding sites in knotted AOTCases (see Fig 3). These sites are located in regions with large number of contacts, where thermal fluctuations and solvent accessibility are reduced. Although the change from knotted to unknotted form of transcarbamoylases did not change much the characteristics of the regions where active sites are located, one should stress that the overall structures of AOTCases and OTCases are very similar and that two out of three essential topological crossings, necessary to form the trefoil knot, are still present in the unknotted OTCase. In the place of knots in AOTCases, OTCases form entanglements that formally are not knotted though.

Comparison between knotted and unknotted carbamoylotransferases and structural characteristics of OTCase.a. Superimposed structures of knotted AOTCase (red, PDB id 3KZN) and unknotted OTCase (yellow, PDB id 4JQO) with ligands (acetylornithine and citrulline respectively, in stick representation). The thick darker fragments denote the short polypeptide chain, whose position determines the topology of the protein. The black oval shows the fragment which was enlarged in Fig 5b. b. Enlarged fragment of Fig 5a with topologically crucial rearrangement of the chain. In the case of OTCase chain, the (dark yellow) loop is much closer to the substrate than the analogous (dark red) loop in case of AOTCase. The gradient arrows denote the chain movement which has to be done in order to change the topology. c. Total number of contacts for OTCase. Here, due to high number of residues, the running average over a window of 3 residues is depicted. d, e. B-factor and SASA for OTCase. Binding residues are marked by violet beads and dashed lines.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165986.g005It is interesting to consider why the knotted and unknotted homologues differ in the substrate specificity. The presence of the knot in the AOTCase keeps one portion of the chain separated from the ligand-binding pocket and thus enlarges it (Fig 5a and 5b). This permits that pocket to bind larger cofactor—N-acetyl-ornithine. In unknotted OTCase the released chain moves towards the ligand-binding pocket (see thick chain section in Fig 5a and 5b), effectively reducing it, as would be required for binding of a smaller ligand, ornithine.DiscussionThe analysed three examples of very different knotted proteins that are unrelated in sequence and function revealed their several similar structural properties that correlate with the presence of deep knots in these proteins. Probably the principal common property of these knotted proteins is strongly increased number of contacts in the border regions of the knotted core (see Figs 1–4). As illustrated in Fig 1d and 1e knot border regions show many contacts as there chains form tight clasps where one segment is locally encircled by the other. High number of intra-chain contacts naturally leads to high thermal stability and to exclusion of solvent from these regions. In addition to borders of the knotted core also other regions within the core show increased number of contacts with the resulting thermal stabilization and solvent exclusion (see Figs 2–4). The active sites (involved in binding of substrates, cofactors and stabilizing ions) of the three proteins show the preference to be localized in the regions with many intra-chain contacts that in turn lead to increased stability and limited solvent accessibility of these sites. Presumably, formation of tight knots with characteristic structural motifs, where portions of polypeptide chains are encircled in a nearly perpendicular direction by other portions of the same chain (see Figs 1, 3 and 4) provide very favourable environment for protein active sites. Of course, protein knotting is not necessary for the formation of regions with increased number of contacts. Knotted AOTCases and unknotted OTCases maintain very similar regions with increased number of contacts. However, unknotted OTCases do form local entanglements maintaining two out of three crossings of knotted AOTCases (see Fig 5).MethodsContact mapsThe contact maps were calculated using Frustratometer server [25]. Two amino acids are treated to be in contact, if the distance between their Cβ (or Cα in case of glycine) is less then 6.5 Ǻ (short-distance contacts), or in range 6.5–9.5 Ǻ (long-distance contacts). The set of long-distance contacts splits into water mediated (between solvent exposed residues) and buried (non-exposed to solvent) [34].Protein structuresProtein structures were taken from RCSB database with original numbering of the residues.Knot detection and matrix representationProtein topological state, matrix representation as well as knotted core and tail lengths were taken from KnotProt database [3]. For Rds3p and AOTCase proteins residue numbering had to be adjusted to RCSB numbering pattern.Structural comparison of the proteinThe structural comparison were conducted using jFATCAT-flexible algorithm using the tool available on RCSB webpage [35, 36].Binding site recognitionThe information about the binding site of proteins were taken directly from PDB structure on RCSB website.Protein depictionMolecular graphics and analyses were performed with the UCSF Chimera package. Chimera is developed by the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco (supported by NIGMS P41-GM103311) [37].Features calculationB-factors for TrmL and AOTCase were the mean residue values taken from the PDB structure. In case of Rds3p protein the mean square displacement of Cα atoms (recorded for each model in NMR structure) was used as an analogue of B-factor. The total SASA was computed using Chimera Software with MSMS package [37, 38]. The values obtained were normalized according to the total surface of amino acids [39] to calculate normalized SASA.Supporting InformationS1 File.

For China, particularly those irrigation areas of northern China, inadequate rainfall and limited surface water supply have seriously impeded the development of agriculture [2]. Since 1992, the irrigation areas in northern China suffered severe drought, leading to a great loss of grain yields that was approximate 17 500 million kilogram every year. Because of the water shortages, some areas in northern China maintained the development of agriculture by excessively exploiting the underground water, and this resulted in a 500 000 km2 ground falls in the border regions of Beijing, Tianjing and Hebei province [3–4]. Presently, China has applied various technologies to deal with the water shortage problems in the northern irrigation areas, including the water conservancy engineering [5–6], the biological water-saving technology [7–8], the optimize arrangement of crops [9], the reclamation of sewage [10] and the saline water irrigation technology [11–12].Although irrigation with saline water relieves fresh water resource shortages in varying degrees, the improper use of saline water (such as the use of saline water with excessive salinity or insufficient irrigation with saline waters) may result in combinations of water and saline stress that lead to the secondary salinization and a series of environmental problems [13–14]. Therefore, the dynamic and distribution of soil salts under saline water irrigation were extensively studied [2, 13, 15–16]. The water-salt dynamic models were used to understand the distribution of soil salts under saline water irrigation, thus providing a reference for the decision of saline water irrigation scheme [13].Tomatoes are sensitive to salts that they can not survive under high salinity condition or only survive with decreased yields [17]. To alleviate the deleterious effects of the salt, several methods such as mixed irrigation with freshwater and saline water [18], and rotated irrigation with freshwater and saline water [19] have been applied. Some studies have specifically examined the effects of saline water irrigation on tomato growth, development, quality, yield and blossom-end rot incidence (BERi) [20–23]. Tomato organoleptic parameters, such as soluble solids, fructose, glucose, titratable acid, and amino acid contents, increase with increasing salinity [20, 24–28]. Of these factors, suitable salt stress can be applied to improve the fruit quality. Although positive indicators of tomato quality have been obtained under saline conditions, it has been reported that tomato yield is negatively affected by increasing salinity [17, 29]. Furthermore, although the tomato BERi is commonly considered as a physiological disorder that caused by calcium deficiency [30], salt stress is one of the main environmental factors to aggravate BERi [31–32].On the other hand, water is also an important factor that affects the growth and development of tomatoes [33]. A reasonable irrigation quota is beneficial for the tomatoes to obtain high yield and good quality. Study on the tomato deficit irrigation has shown that the soluble solid, vitamin C, sugar, acid, and sugar to acid ratio in the fruits increase with a lower water supply, resulting in an improved overall quality of tomatoes [34–35]. Moreover, under deficit irrigation condition, the acid invertase, neutral invertase, proline, glucose and fructose in the tomato fruits are increased, and this helps the tomato plants to be more adaptive to the drought stress [36–37]. However, low water supply reduces the tomato yields, which decreases the weight of single fruit but has no significant effects on the fruit number [33, 38]. On the contrary, excessive water supply leads to the spindling of tomatoes, limits the tomato physiological and reproductive growth, finally causes a low tomato yield [39–40]. In addition, water supply has certain connections with the tomato BERi, while water whether to directly affect the BERi is still not fully understood [41]. Besides, under the condition of irrigation combined with mulching, soil salt was found to move towards the edge of the mulch, thus the salinity within the plant root-zone was decreased, which created a suitable environment for the growth of tomato [42].Presently, there are some studies focused on the regularity of soil salt distribution under the saline water irrigation, but which under special control conditions such as straw mulching have been less studied. Besides, although many studies have independently investigated the tomato responses to different salinity of irrigation waters and different irrigation amount, few studies have looked into their combined effects on the tomato growth, quality, yield and BERi. And most of all, in southern China, it is important for the irrigation agriculture to find a tomato irrigation scheme that not only maintains normal output but also with a better fruit quality, a higher IWUE and a relatively lower salt residual in plough layer. In this experiment, the tomatoes were treated with different irrigation water salinities and irrigation quotas under a mulch of dry straws, and the tomato responses and the soil salt distribution under these treatments were compared and analyzed. For crop performance, we hypothesized that all environmental factors have the same effects on tomato growth and development. The objectives of this study were to understand the soil salt distribution laws and the tomato responses to different saline water treatments, and to find out improved saline water irrigation methods with best comprehensive effects that improve the fruit quality, increase the tomato IWUE and relatively reduce the soil salt residual but do not significantly decrease the tomato yields in northern China. These treatments were compared with a freshwater (F) irrigation treatment.Materials and MethodsExperiment ConditionsThe experiment was carried out in 2014 (May-September) at Modern Agriculture Park of Xinzhou city, Shanxi Province, northern China (The experiment was permitted by the owner of the land named Dong Qiuyue). The experimental site belongs to a temperate continental monsoon climate and enjoys four clear seasons. The annual mean temperature of the experimental site is 4.3°C-9.2°C and the mean precipitation is 345 mm-588 mm (data from 1960–2010). In addition, heavy rains in the experimental site have the characters of small area, short duration, strong intensity and unevenness in time and space, they mainly happened during July-August, accounting for 83.7% of the total rainy days. The soil type in the experimental fields is sandy loam, with bulk density of 1.34 g/cm3, organic matter of 1.36%, salt content of 1.13 g/kg, alkali-hydrolyzale N of 94.58 mg/kg, available P of 18.44 mg/kg, and available K of 77.86 mg/kg, in 0–20 cm soil layer.Experimental DesignThe experiment was conducted in a plastic-covered greenhouse, and the tomato type for experiment was “Yinshidahong”. After the soils were ploughed uniformly, the seedlings were transplanted to the experimental blocks. During the seedling stage, the same field managements were applied among different treatments. Soil ridges were constructed for tomatoes, and the ridges were 4.4 m length and 0.6 m width, with a 1.4 m distance between them. Two lines of tomatoes were transplanted to one ridge with the line spacing of 0.3 m and the row spacing of 0.4 m, and the planting density was about 3.6×104 plants/hm2. To provided the nutrients necessary for tomato plant growth, the experiment fields were fertilized with 700 kg/hm2 of N: P2O5: K2O = 1:2:2 compound fertilizer. The 3–5 cm dry straws of paddy rice were used as the mulch material, of which the mulch amount was 4000 kg/hm2, mulching uniformly at 20 days after seedling transplanting.According to the experience from early study [43], we designed three saline water treatments: 1.0 dS/m (F), 3.0 dS/m (S1), 5.0 dS/m (S2), combined with three irrigation quotas: 280 mm (W1), 320 mm (W2), 360 mm (W3), grouped as 9 treatments, each treatment was replicated 3 times, as shown in Table 1. Three ridges of tomatoes were gathered as one treatment, which was applied with the same salinity and irrigation quota. Flood irrigation according to the local practice was applied. For the treatments with different irrigation quotas, the irrigation times was the same (13 times), while the irrigation amount each irrigation time was different. An impermeable membrane at a depth of 60 cm was used between the different treatments to prevent lateral seepage of the irrigation water. In this experiment, the freshwater (F) was the local underground water with the EC of 1.0 dS/m, saline water (S) were prepared with these underground waters.

The ionic compositions of the different irrigation water treatments.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165985.t002The lateral tomato plant branches were removed during the growth period, and topping treatments were applied in a timely manner. Each tomato plant was allowed to reserve 4 fruit sequences. Pest control was conducted according to the actual situation in the experimental fields.MeasurementsThe concentrations of K+ and Na+ in the saline water were measured using flame photometry method. The concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ were measured using the atomic absorption spectrophotometry method. The concentrations of Cl-, SO42- were measured using the anionic chromatography method. The concentrations of CO32- and HCO3- were measured using the double indicators-neutralization titration method [44].The leaf area index (LAI) was measured at every stage using an LAI 2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (Li-Cor Biosciences USA). The maximum LAI (LAIm) of each treatment was extracted for analysis.The tomato yield (Yt), BERi and marketable tomato yield (Ym) were determined at the harvest stage, and tomato fruits were picked manually every 3–5 days. For each harvest, the number and weights of good fruits and the fruits with BERi were recorded. Ym was calculated as follows (The malformed fruits were very little and ignored here) [29]:To determine the tomato quality in each treatment, 20 tomato fruits with red or orange colors were collected randomly to measure the quality indexes. The quality indexes included the volume (VF), density (ρF), soluble solids content (Ds), total acidity content (G), vitamin C content (VC) and sugar/acid ratio (RSA). The VF was measured using the displacement method, and the ρF was calculated based on the tomato volume and weight. In addition, Ds was measured using an ACT-1E digital refractometer (ATAGO Company, Japan), and the total sugar content was measured using the Fehling reagent titration method. The G was measured using the sodium hydroxide titration method, and the Vc content was measured using the 2, 6-dichloroindophenol titrimetric method [17, 45].IWUE (kg/m3) was calculated as [46]:Where, I was the irrigation amount (m3) during the whole growth stage of tomatoes.The soil samples for measuring the mass fraction of salt in the soil profile (0–20 cm, 20–40 cm, 40–60 cm, 60–80 cm) was collected on September 18th, after the last harvest of tomatoes.Data AnalysisThe data were statistically compared using a one-way ANOVA with Duncan’s Multiple Range Test at the 0.05 probability level (using the SPSS software, Version 17.0) [47]. The quality indexes for the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were also obtained from the SPSS software. The principal components of the quality indexes were extracted following the principle of “eigenvalue > 1, cumulative contribution rate > 80%” [48].Projection pursuit (PP) ModelThe PP model is a well-developed method for selecting the optimal scheme when there were various schemes with various evaluation indexes. Here, the PP model is used to select the optimal irrigation scheme from the 9 treatments of this experiment, and the optimal irrigation scheme should possess the best integrated benefits based on the evaluation indexes including the tomato comprehensive quality, Yt, Ym, IWUE and the soil salinity after irrigation.The essence of PP model is to use computer technology to project high dimensional data to lower dimensional space, and search for the projection which could well reflect the characters of high dimensional data, then study the structures of high dimensional data in a low dimensional space. The modeling method is as follows [49–50]:Establish the evaluation matrix. Suppose the number of treatments is n, number of evaluation indexes is p, the jth index of ith sample is xij*, then the evaluation indexes could be expressed by an n×p matrix X*.Quantify the evaluation indexes. In order to eliminate the differences of dimension, following measures are taken:For the \"the larger the better\" index:For the \"the smaller the better\" index:A new n×p matrix X can be obtained based on the qualified indexes.Linear projection. The essence of linear projection is to observe the data from different angles, to search for the best projective direction which could well reflect the characters of the data, therefore, suppose the unit vector a = {a1,a2,…ap} as the one dimensional projective direction, and zi as the one dimensional projective eigenvalue.Constructs an object function for projection. Express the object function (Q(a)) as the product of distances between classes and density between classes:Where Sz is the standard value of projective eigenvalue zi, also named distances between classes, Dz is the density between classes of zi.Where E(z) is the average of the array {zi|i = 1~n|}.Where, R is window radius of local density;Optimize the object function by maximization:Evaluation. The contribution of evaluation index can be obtained according to the best projective direction, and the stand or fall of the treatments can be also obtained based on the zi value.In this study, the PP model was built using the Matlab software (Version 7.1), and the Real Adaptive Parallel Genetic Algorithm (RAGA) was used to optimize the PP model. Before optimizations, the main parameters were set as: the original population size n = 400, the probabilities of crossover Pc = 0.8, the probabilities of mutation Pm = 0.8, the number of excellent individuals Ne = 20, α = 0.05 and accelerating times Na = 20 [51].ResultsEffects of different treatments on the LAIm of tomatoFig 1 shows the effects of different saline water treatments on the LAI of tomatoes. The LAI at 10 days after transplant were in a range of 0.53–0.84, and LAI at 30 days after transplant ranged from 1.39 to 1.99. Under the same irrigation quota, the tomato LAIm decreased as the increase of salinity. LAIm under W1 irrigation quota presented most dramatic decrease, which of S2 was 13.2% lower than that of F, indicating that low irrigation quota combined with high salinity limited the increase of tomato leaf area. On the other hand, under the three salinity levels, the tomato LAIm all increased as the increase of irrigation quota, of which 5 dS/m increased the tomato LAIm most significantly that was 17.0% compared between W1 and W3. This probably due to the salt leaching effects of high irrigation quota that relieved the salt stress for the tomato growth and development.

Overall, lower irrigation quota or higher salinity increased the ρF, DS, G, VC and RSA but decreased the VF of tomatoes. From the effects of irrigation quota and salinity and their combinations on the tomato quality, it was concluded that the salinity of irrigation waters significantly affected the ρF, VF, DS, G, VC and RSA of tomatoes, and the irrigation quota significantly affected the ρF, VF, DS, VC and RSA of tomatoes, but their combined effects had no significant effects on these quality indexes of tomatoes.

The quality index values are the means of three replications. Each value is the mean ± SD (n = 3). * and ** represent that the treatment has significant (p<0.05) and much significant (p<0.01) effects on the value of quality index).              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165985.g002The PCA model was used to extract the principal components of the tomato quality indexes, and the comprehensive indexes of tomato quality with different irrigation treatments were shown as Fig 3. The calculated eigenvalue and accumulating contribution rate was 4.861 and 81.01%, respectively, which retained great original information of tomato quality indexes. A higher comprehensive quality index indicates a higher comprehensive quality (the 6 indexes observed) of the tomatoes. Therefore, in this study, the irrigation treatment with lowest irrigation quota but highest salinity (S2W1) resulted in an overall better tomato quality, comprehensive quality index reaching 3.61; followed by S1W1, with the comprehensive quality index of 3.12; FW3 obtained the most unsatisfactory overall quality of tomatoes, the comprehensive quality index of which was only 1.00. This indicates that decreased the irrigation quota or increased the salinity of irrigation waters resulted in an overall better tomato quality.

Under the same irrigation quota, the total tomato Yt and Ym with S1 salinity had not presented significant (P>0.05) decline trend compared with F salinity, however, the tomato Yt and Ym with S2 salinity were significantly (P≤0.05) lower that that with F salinity (by 17.91–20.48% and 22.89–24.76%, respectively). Under the same salinity of irrigation waters, the tomato Yt and Ym overall increased with higher irrigation quota. For the single factor of tomato yield, FW3 was proved to be the better treatments that the tomato Yt and Ym of which reached 125.8 t/hm2 and 120.4 t/hm2. Besides, it was found that the BERi obviously increased under S2 salinity, and was by 9.48–11.74% higher compared with F, which finally led to a negative effect on the tomato Ym of S2.

After a growth season of tomatoes, the soil salts mainly accumulated in the plough layer, mass fraction of which in 0–20 cm, 20–40 cm, 40–60 cm and 60–80 cm layer was 1.11–1.84 g/kg, 0.91–1.45 g/kg, 0.87–1.39 g/kg and 0.72–1.21 g/kg. Under the same irrigation quota, the soil salt mass fraction increased as the salinity of irrigation water increased, of which S2 was 28.83–44.88%, 18.85–39.56%, 29.91–42.53% and 34.61%-44.04% higher compared to F, respectively in the four layers. On the other hand, under the same salinity of irrigation water, salts were presented to move to the deeper soil layer when with higher irrigation quota. W2 and W3 irrigation quota decreased the soil salts in 0–20 cm and 20–40 cm layer compared to W1, but which significantly increased the salts in 40–60 cm and 60–80 cm layer, this indicated that a higher irrigation quota was more effective to leach the salts in plough layer and reduce their accumulation.

The maximal projective index value that calculated by PP model was 0.2793, the best projective direction a(j)* = (0.0105, 0.6211, 0.5597, 0.1548, 0.5262), and the projective value of S1W1, S1W2, S1W3, S2W1, S2W2 and S2W3 were ordered to be z(i)* = (0.9311, 0.9311, 1.8075, 0.0871, 0.3671, 0.7981). A higher projective value indicates a better comprehensive benefit of saline water irrigation treatment. Therefore, S1W3 is the optimal treatment, followed by S1W1 and S1W2.For S1W3, Y and Ym had not decreased significantly as the salinity of irrigation water increased, and were both the highest among the six saline water irrigation treatments. Besides, although the comprehensive quality index and IWUE of S1W3 were not in a superior level relative to other treatments, the index weight (projective direction) of comprehensive quality index (0.0105) was the lowest, thus did not significantly changed the evaluation results. According to the calculations of PP model, 3.0 dS/m salinity of irrigation waters combined with 360 mm irrigation quota was recommended as the best saline water irrigation scheme for the tomato in northern China.DiscussionAlthough the water resources in the world are abundant, the available water resources are insufficient. The total amount of water resources in the world is 1 400 million km3, of which the freshwater resources only accounted for 2.8%, and the surface water and shallow ground water that are available accounted for 0.35% of the freshwaters [52]. Agriculture needs a large amount of water and is facing more shortage than other sectors. Presently, 80% of the world’s irrigation system adopts the diversion irrigating method, and the irrigated agriculture will continue to play an important role in meeting the needs of the world population for food [53]. In China, severe droughts often happen in the northern irrigated areas, which limit the sustainable development of agriculture. As a practical method for saving freshwater resources, saline water irrigation in northern China gradually become a hot topic, but until now there were no accepted criterions for saline water management. Thus, it is important to develop suitable management methods for using saline water to meet the challenges of sustainable irrigated agriculture that conserve water resources and have minimum impacts on the soil environment and the crop growth and development.Our study demonstrated that the lower irrigation quota and higher salinity increased the ρF, DS, G, VC and RSA but decreased the LAIm and VF of tomatoes, but there were no significant combining effects on the quality indexes. This was probably because that the tomatoes adjusted initiatively to adapt the water stress when under a lower irrigation quota, the content of osmoregulation substances such as proline, glucose and fructose in tomatoes increased, which had positive effects on the tomato quality [54]. High salinity of irrigation water increased the sugar concentration might due to the enhanced activity of sucrose invertase [55]. A similar study conducted by Beckles [56] also showed that increasing the soil electrical conductivity (EC), either by applying a high ionic solution or by restricting watering, resulted in a higher sugar concentration per fruit.Early study showed that when the insufficient water supply limited the vegetative growth of tomatoes, the fruits would continue to accumulate the organics to reduce the impacts of water deficit, in this period, the accumulated organics were used in the cell wall synthesis and other process related to the fruit development in order to make up for the loss of photosynthetic production decrease [57]. However, the long period of water deficit resulted in the elasticity loss of cell walls, thus led to the decreased yields. The salinity-induced yield reductions could result from decreased inflow of water into the fruits [58], and under saline water irrigation, the reduction in fruit yield corresponded to reductions in the fruit weight and number [59]. In this study, high salinity combined with low irrigation quota (S2W1) obtained the lowest tomato yield, which was in consistent with the early studies.BER is commonly regarded as a calcium-deficient physiological disease [60], and water and salt are two improvement environmental factors affected its incidence. Selby [61] noted that the BERi was related to the soil moisture, and further study demonstrated that the deficient or excessive water both increased the BERi. Mohamed [62] also found that the BERi under excessive water supply was significantly higher than that under normality. In our study, the BERi was negatively related to the irrigation quota, indicating that 360 mm irrigation quota was not excessive according to Mohamed’s study. However, some studies proved that the water affected the BERi was an accidental phenomena [63–64]. In addition, our study also showed that the high salinity obviously increased the BERi (of which S2W1 was the highest), it might because that the high salinity of irrigation water impeded the water absorption of tomato fruits [65], thus the calcium was difficult to move from the tomato root to the fruit bottom [66].After one season tomato cultivation, the salt mass fraction of different soil layers that using saline water were increased to various degrees compared to that of freshwater, and the salts mainly accumulated in the plough layer. Yang [67] conducted a similar study as us but obtained a much higher increase of soil salt mass fraction in the plough layer, this may have occurred because that the temperature was relatively lower at the end of our experiment, thus the soil resalinization was slighter. Moreover, soil salts had a tendency to move to the deeper soil layer when using 320 mm and 360 mm irrigation quota, this agrees with Wang’s [68] study conclusions. In our study, the salt distribution might not be affected by only irrigation amount, but also by the mulching. Taia A. Abd El-Mageed [69] conducted a thorough experiment and pointed out that noticeable decrease in salts accumulation in the root zone could be associated with soil mulching application.Projection pursuit model has been widely used in the optimization of irrigation regime. Hou [70] adopted the projection pursuit model to select the best drip irrigation scheme for crop. Other methods, such as principal component analysis, entropy weight coefficient model were also used for guiding the agricultural production [71]. The essence of these models was the same, namely realizing the reduction of high-dimensional data. When using the models to select an irrigation scheme, various indexes should be considered. However, most early studies noticed only the crop yield, water use and irrigation water consumption. Wu [72] took the crop growth, Yt, overall quality and water use into consideration when choosing a saline water irrigation regime, but has not involved the amount of residual salt in soil.For northern China, a good scheme of saline water irrigation for tomatoes should not only consider the quality and Yt, but also involve the Ym, IWUE and the soil salt residual after irrigation. In this study, the optimal saline water irrigation scheme selected by the PP model was S1W3, 3.0 dS/m salinity combined with 360 mm irrigation quota. PP model avoided the one-sidedness of using the subjective weight independently, thus the results that were obtained were more reliable. The optimal treatment S1W3 in this study possessed the best comprehensive benefit (tomato overall quality, Yt, Ym, IWUE and soil salt residual), and was recommended as the saline water irrigation scheme for tomatoes in northern China. However, in this experiment, the irrigation waters were distributed evenly according to the whole growth stage of tomatoes, the uneven distribution of saline waters according to different growth stage of tomatoes may have different effects on the tomato growth and development. Therefore, more researches on this topic are needed in future.ConclusionCompared to freshwater, saline water irrigations decreased the LAIm of tomatoes, and LAIm presented a decline tendency with higher salinity and lower irrigation quota. The ρF, Ds, G, VC and RSA increased but the VF decreased as the salinity increased and irrigation quota decreased. S2W1 treatment obtained the best overall quality of tomatoes, with the comprehensive quality index of 3.61. A higher salinity and lower irrigation quota caused a decrease in individual fruit weight and an increase in BERi, finally led to a reduction in Yt and Ym. After one growth season of tomato, the mass fraction of soil salts in plough layer with S2W1 treatment was the highest, and which presented a decline trend with increasing irrigation quota. Moreover, compared to W1, soil salts had a tendency to move to the deeper soil layer when using W2 and W3 irrigation quota. According to the calculation results of PP model, S1W3 was the optimal treatment, which possessed the best comprehensive benefit (tomato overall quality, Yt, Ym, IWUE and soil salt residual), and was recommended as the saline water irrigation scheme for tomatoes in northern China.AcknowledgmentsThis work was financed by Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu province (BK20130838) and Natural Science Foundation of China (51409086).Author ContributionsConceptualization: YZ.Data curation: YZ YW.Formal analysis: YZ.Funding acquisition: YZ.Investigation: YZ.Methodology: YZ YW.Project administration: YZ.Software: YZ YW.Validation: YZ.Writing – original draft: YZ.Writing – review & editing: QY.References1.

Given the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in all age groups, already children are affected by elevated blood pressure (BP) [1–4]. Further, elevated childhood BP has been shown to predict elevated BP in adolescence and adulthood [5–7] and other adulthood cardiovascular diseases [8–10]. Serum and erythrocyte fatty acids (FA) have been suggested to be associated with BP in adults [11–13] although not all studies confirmed this association [14].In particular, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and their metabolites, the long-chain PUFA (LC PUFA) such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) of the n-3 series and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4n-6) of the n-6 series have been linked to BP [11, 12, 14]. As precursors for the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes with effects on vasodilation and platelet aggregation LC PUFA can affect BP [15]. Additionally, ARA and EPA are substrates for the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) catalyzed biosynthesis of metabolites of which the ARA metabolite 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) has been shown to act as a vasoconstrictor. In contrast, epoxides of ARA like epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and of n-3 LC PUFA like epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids seem to exert BP lowering effects, e.g. by increasing nitric oxide production and vasodilation [16, 17]. Beneficial effects of n-3 LC PUFA on BP have also been attributed to their role as competitors of n-6 LC PUFA in the biosynthesis of eicosanoids and lipid mediators including those catalyzed by CYP450 [18]. Additionally, 20-HETE and EETs are involved in renal tubular and vascular function that may affect BP [19–21].Intervention studies with fish oil supplements or n-3 rich fatty fish showed a small blood pressure lowering effect [22]. Also a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with EPA and DHA supplementation concluded that n-3 LC PUFA lowers systolic BP (SBP) and in high doses also diastolic BP (DBP) [23]. However, data from observational studies and from the limited number of intervention studies in children are less consistent [18]. Three studies reported positive associations between childhood n-3 LC PUFA and BP. In Danish children, cross-sectional data indicated whole blood EPA to be positively associated with DBP in boys but not in girls [24] while in Danish adolescents DHA was positively associated with SBP [25]. In a Finnish cohort, the sum of serum cholesterylester n-3 PUFA in childhood was positively associated with BP in adulthood after 27 years in males but not in females [26]. Against the background of the presumed biological mechanisms and results of intervention studies in adults, the reported positive associations of n-3 PUFA and BP were unexpected. Therefore, this study investigates the cross-sectional and prospective associations between whole blood n-3 and n-6 PUFA and BP in a large cohort of European children.MethodsStudy groupIn the IDEFICS (Identification and prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants) baseline survey (T0) in 2007/2008, a population-based sample of 16 228 children aged 2 to 9.9 years from eight European countries (Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Sweden) was examined. Follow-up examinations were conducted two (T1) and six (T3, I.Family study) years later; the study design has been described in detail elsewhere [27, 28]. In brief, the IDEFICS/I.Family study comprises one of the largest prospective European child cohorts. The main focus of the IDEFICS study was to investigate diet- and lifestyle related disorders in young children with a focus on overweight and obesity. A further follow-up of the health status including 7105 children of the original IDEFICS cohort was performed in the I.Family study to explore the determinants of dietary and other lifestyle behaviors in these children and adolescents as they have grown older. A large set of anthropometric and clinical examinations was conducted and biosamples were taken as well as several questionnaires and interviews were collected. Lifestyle behaviors like dietary intake, physical activity and screen time of young children up to the age of 11 years were reported by parents whereas this information was self-reported by adolescents. Parents reported their own educational level and lifestyle behaviors like smoking in self-completion questionnaires. In a face-to-face interview the health conditions of the participating child and the family history of diseases were collected by trained interviewers.Since in IDEFICS community- and setting-oriented intervention programs were implemented, in each country two mutually comparable areas have been allocated to either serve as intervention or control region [29].Parents gave written informed consent for themselves and for their participating children. Children aged 12 years and over also gave written informed consent while small children gave oral consent prior to the start of the examinations. The participating centers in each country obtained ethical approval by the competent Institutional Review Boards prior to starting the study. These were the following ethics committees: Ethics Committee, University Hospital, Gent, Belgium; Cyprus National Bioethics Committee, Nicosia, Cyprus; Tallinn Medical Research Ethics Committee, Tallinn, Estonia; Ethics Committee of the University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany; Egészségügyi Tudományos Tanács, Pécs, Hungary; Azienda Sanitaria Locale Avellino Comitato Etico, Avellino, Italy; Regionala Etikprövningsnämnden i Göteborg, Gothenburg, Sweden; Comité Ético de Investigación Clínica de Aragón, Zaragoza, Spain. The examinations were conducted by trained field work teams. The authors of this manuscript had no contact to the participants.This study is based on a subsample of IDEFICS T0 participants with an oversampling of overweight and obese children [27]. FA profiles were analyzed in 2600 children of which 10 children were excluded because of blood drawing in a non-fasting state. Furthermore, only children with at least one follow-up measurement were included such that additional 1297 children had to be excluded due to missing BP, missing follow-up or missing covariate data. Because the remaining sample of children from Belgium and Cyprus consisted of only 15 and 11 children, respectively, these were not considered in the final analysis resulting in an analysis sample of 1267 children (Fig 1). The age range of the children was 2–9 years at T0, 4–11 years at T1 and 9–16 years at T3, respectively.

Flow chart of the inclusion and exclusion of IDEFICS/I.Family participants.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165981.g001ExposuresBlood was obtained by collecting a drop of blood from a fingertip or by venipuncture which was applied directly to a test strip prepared with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). FA in whole blood were separated and determined by gas-liquid chromatography after direct derivatisation to their methyl esters without prior extraction of total lipids from the samples in a central laboratory as previously described [30, 31]. This simple and rapid analysis method was validated by several laboratories [31–33]. Whole blood includes FA from all lipid classes and is representative for the total FA pool [32]. In the present analysis we used FA values of the n-3 PUFA alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and the n-6 PUFA linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3n-6), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA, 20:3n-6) and arachidonic acid. FA are expressed as weight percentage of all FA detected (% wt/wt).OutcomesSBP and DBP was measured at the right arm with a cuff of appropriate size for arm circumference after at least 5 minutes of rest in seated position according to a standardized protocol with an automated oscillometric device (Welch Allyn, Inc., 4200B-E2, Skaneateles Falls, NY, USA) [34]. Two recordings were taken, with a 2-min interval between each, plus a third measurement in case of a >5% difference between the first two readings. The mean value of the two measurements with the smallest difference was used as outcome measure. If the first and second measurement deviated by >5% and no third measurement value was obtained BP was set to missing. For SBP, DBP and BP classification to normal BP, pre-hypertension and hypertension, age, sex and height specific reference values from the US Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (NIH, 2005) [35] were applied. SBP and DBP were further transformed to age-, sex- and height-specific z-scores according to the NIH references and were used as outcome variables in the subsequent analysis.Anthropometric dataHeight of the children was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with a calibrated stadiometer (Seca 225/213 stadiometer, Birmingham, UK). Body weight was assessed in fasting state in light underwear on a calibrated scale accurate to 0.1 kg (adapted Tanita BC 420 MA for children ≤6 years, BC 418 MA for children >6 years, Tanita Europe GmbH, Sindelfingen, Germany). BMI was calculated as weight [kg] divided by height [m] squared.ConfoundersPotential confounders such as age (continuous), sex, country (6 categories: Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Sweden), maximum ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education [36]) level of parents (three categories: low level (ISCED 0,1,2); medium (ISCED 3,4); high (ISCED 5,6)) [36], parental smoking (5 categories, only assessed at T3: current daily smoker; current occasional smoker; ex-smoker; ex-smoker with missing pack years; never smoker), family history of hypertension (yes vs. no; as reported for biological parents/siblings at any of the three time points), BMI z-scores calculated based on Cole & Lobstein (2012) [37], height, birth weight and pubertal stage (pubertal, pre-pubertal, no information available; defined based on voice change in boys and first menstrual period in girls) were considered. To account for individual variations in the whole blood FA content depending on the FA distribution in lipid classes of plasma, lipoproteins and red blood cells of whole blood [32], we included weight percentage of total saturated (SFA) and total monounsaturated FA (MUFA) of total FA as covariates. A binary variable indicating control versus intervention regions was used to adjust for potential differences resulting from the intervention [29]. As indicator of dietary salt intake we used the weekly frequency of processed food consumption which includes Hamburger, hot dog, kebab, wrap, falafel, salty snacks such as savory pastries and fritters as well as cold cuts and ready to cook meat products. Television and computer time calculated as average screen time per week was also considered as a potential confounder.Physical activity (PA) was measured objectively in a subset of children using the uniaxial Actigraph accelerometer (Actigraph MTI, model GT1M, Manufacturing Technology Inc., Fort Walton Beach, FL, USA) and the ActiTrainer which was the same technology as the Actigraph. We used time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) according to the cut-points of Evenson et al. (2008) [38] including children with at least 3 accelerometer measurement days and at least 360 minutes of valid time per day as indicator of PA in sensitivity analyses.Statistical analysesMixed-effects models were used to assess the associations between the different FA measured at baseline and BP z-scores over time. These models provide a flexible tool to model repeated measurements data as they do not require individuals to be measured at the same ages and as subjects with a varying number of repeated measurements can be considered under a missing at random assumption[39]. They further allow for correlations among repeated measurements taken from the same subject. In the present analysis, all children with a baseline and at least one follow-up BP measurement were included (N = 1267; 1267 baseline measurements; 1069 T1 measurements and 667 T3 measurements). A variable indicating time since baseline was constructed to assess how associations change over time (takes the values 0 for the baseline survey, approx. 2 years for the first follow-up and approx. 6 years for the second follow-up). The model was built as follows:BPi,j denotes the outcome value of individual i measured at time j (i = 1,…N where N denotes the number of study subjects; j = 0,1,2 denotes the survey wave), β0 denotes the intercept, ui,0 a random subject-specific intercept, β1 indicates the yearly change in average BP levels since baseline, ui,1 is a random subject-specific slope allowing BP to change differently in individuals over time, β2 is the effect of the T0 exposure on the outcome at T0, β3 describes the change per year in the effect of the FA exposure at baseline on BP over time and finally βcovars was used to indicate all effect estimates of the covariates included in the different models (e.g. if age and sex were included as covariates, βcovars would indicate the two effect estimates βage and βsex for age and sex). εi,j is the error term for individual i at time j. An unstructured covariance matrix was selected for the random effects, i.e. each variance/covariance could take the value that the data demand.For all exposures and the two outcomes (SBP z-score, DBP z-score), a basic model adjusting only for age (continuous), sex, height, country and intervention vs. control region (dummy variable) was estimated in a first step. In a second step, the following covariates were added to the basic model: maximum ISCED level of parents, parental smoking, family history of hypertension, BMI z-score, pubertal status, birth weight, weight percentage of the sum of SFA and of MUFA of total FA, weekly frequency of processed food consumption and weekly hours of screen time (fully adjusted model). Due to the significant interaction between EPA and weight status, models were further estimated stratified by sex and stratified by BMI category (thin/normal weight vs. overweight/obese; categorization according to Cole & Lobstein (2012) [37]).In the subgroup with available accelerometer data (N = 1035), the fully adjusted model was additionally adjusted for minutes in MVPA.All analyses were performed using SAS® statistical software version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). All models were run using SAS Proc Mixed.P values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons because of the explorative nature of this study. A P value of 0.01 was used as the level of statistical significance to account at least partially for multiple testing.ResultsThe baseline characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1. Of the girls, 20.7% and of the boys 20.2% were classified as pre-hypertensive or hypertensive. BP z-scores were higher in girls than in boys. Weight percentages of PUFA were similar among BP categories. 42% of the children were overweight or obese with slightly more boys than girls being classified as obese. BMI z-scores were higher whereas birth weight was slightly lower in children with normal BP compared to hypertensive children. Among the 220 children with a family history of hypertension, 27.3% were pre-hypertensive or hypertensive while this was true for only 19.0% of the 1047 children without family history of hypertension. 21.5% of children whose parents were current smokers were pre-hypertensive or hypertensive whereas this applied to 18.0% of children with never or ex-smoker parents.

The observed positive association between ARA and BP pointed to the same direction in all subgroups. In thin/normal weight children, inverse associations of baseline ALA and EPA with SBP z-score at baseline and after 2 years of follow up and of baseline ALA with subsequent DBP z-score were observed. Children classified as overweight/obese showed a positive association of baseline EPA with DBP z-score at baseline. For instance, one unit increase of baseline EPA was associated with 0.85 units lower SBP z-score at baseline in thin/normal weight children but with 0.54 higher DBP z-score at baseline in overweight/obese children.

ALA and EPA showed a beneficial effect on BP in the subgroup of thin/normal weight children in contrast to the results of previous observational studies investigating childhood blood n-3 PUFA (EPA and/or DHA) and BP [24–26, 40]. However, in overweight/obese children an unfavorable effect of EPA was observed. Thus, this study shows that already in children the weight status seems to modify the inverse association of n-3 FA with BP.n-6 PUFAThe adverse effect of high ARA on BP observed in our study confirms previous results in adults [41, 42] which to our knowledge have not been shown in children before. In contrast, in a Finnish cohort childhood serum cholesterylester levels of ARA were inversely associated with the BP after 27 years of follow-up but fat intake in Finland has strongly changed over time [26] and is probably different from our study population. Additionally, other factors may play a more important role after this long time period. ARA metabolites like prostaglandins and 20-HETE have vasoconstrictive, and thus blood pressure increasing, effects [15–17]. Additionally, ARA is a reliable indicator for animal-derived foods because the key desaturase steps in the conversion of LA to ARA, delta-6 desaturase (D6D) and delta-5 desaturase (D5D), are inhibited by high concentrations of the substrate [15]. Thus, high blood ARA reflects a higher consumption of animal-derived foods with high intake of animal fats. Such a dietary pattern has also been shown to be associated with elevated BP because of the corresponding high sodium intake [43]. We observed the association of baseline ARA with BP after 6 years of follow up. This may indicate that the adverse effects of the dietary pattern may become stronger with increasing age as dietary patterns have been shown to track from childhood to adolescence [44].As observed in boys in our study, a positive association of GLA with BP was also found in Chinese and Western Alaskan Native adults [13, 45]. GLA is generated from LA by D6D and can—after being elongated to DGLA—further be desaturated by D5D to ARA. As D6D activity is higher and D5D activity is lower in male subjects [46, 47], the positive association in boys may be explained by sex differences in desaturase activity.n-3 PUFAOur results indicate a protective role of ALA and EPA against hypertension in thin/normal weight children whereas in overweight/obese children high EPA seemed to affect DBP unfavourably. Beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA on BP have been shown in several intervention studies investigating the effect of supplemental FA intake [48–50] and in observational studies investigating dietary intake [8, 23, 51–53]. While observational studies investigating the association of n-3 PUFA blood levels and BP showed beneficial effects in adults [11, 42], results in children and adolescents were not consistent and indicated unfavorable effects [24, 25, 40]. In a Danish cross-sectional study including 8–11 year old children, whole-blood EPA was associated with a 2.7 mmHg higher DBP per weight% EPA in boys but not in girls [24]. Also in a large Finnish study an unexpected positive association of childhood cholesterylester EPA with BP after 27 years was observed indicating a stronger association in men than in women [26]. We did not observe sex-specific but a weight status-specific disparity in the n-3 PUFA-BP association in our study indicating a protective role of n-3 PUFA only in thin/normal weight children. Thus, the unfavorable effects of a high BMI and an altered n-3 PUFA status may have overlaid the protective effects of n-3 PUFA on BP. In line with our results, in Alaskan Native adults an inverse association of a marine food biomarker in blood and BP was observed in non-obese but not in obese subjects. The interaction of weight status and the biomarker was only significant for DBP but not for SBP [54]. In our analysis group, a high proportion of children (42%) were overweight or obese. Already in children, BMI has a strong independent blood pressure increasing effect [55, 56], and thus in our study sample obese children were more often hypertensive than thin or normal weight children. Additionally, overweight and obese children enter puberty usually earlier than thin or normal weight children [57, 58]. As BP increases with puberty [59, 60] and early puberty has shown to be a risk factor for later high BP [57], this may have also contributed to higher BP in overweight/obese children. Also, inflammatory cytokines and adipocytokines from adipose tissue in overweight and obese subjects were shown to increase blood pressure [61, 62] such that obesity-related effects on BP may have overlaid the BP lowering effects of n-3 PUFA observed in thin/normal weight children.Data on the influence of BMI on blood n-3 LC PUFA concentrations are inconsistent [40, 63] whereas lower estimated D5D activity has consistently been observed in obese subjects compared to normal weight subjects indicating a less effective last desaturation step to ARA and EPA, respectively [63, 64]. Therefore, obese children may synthesize less EPA from its precursor. However, in our study, EPA percentages were slightly higher in overweight/obese children compared to thin/normal weight children (data not shown). This may have resulted from a higher total energy intake and a dietary pattern with high consumption of animal-derived foods including fish with high n-3 LC PUFA as also ARA percentages were higher in the upper BMI categories reflecting higher consumption of animal-derived fats as discussed before and as shown for overweight/obese subjects in previous studies [65–67].Higher dietary EPA intake may be required to achieve BP lowering effects, particularly regarding DBP, as shown in a meta-analysis on the effects of fish oil or n-3 LC PUFA supplements on BP [23]. As children and adolescents generally do not meet the recommended dietary intake of n-3 LC PUFA [68], an increase of dietary EPA may beneficially influence BP.According to a recent meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies in adult populations higher circulating DHA levels may prevent from elevated blood pressure [69]. In agreement with this, our data point to an inverse association of DHA with SBP in thin/normal weight children at baseline though the effect estimate did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, two smaller cross-sectional studies showed that whole-blood DHA was positively associated with DBP in 8–11 year old boys [40] and that erythrocyte DHA was positively related with SBP in 17 year old adolescents [25].In our analysis, we used \"time since baseline\" (instead of age) as the main time axis in order to assess how associations between the FA exposures and BP change over time. However, when using age as the main time axis instead, we found that the association between ALA and SBP decreases with age whereas associations between ARA and DHA with BP increase with age.Limitations and strengthsA limitation of our study is that the repeated blood pressure measurements were taken only on a single occasion at each survey wave whereas confirmation of BP values on repeated visits or even ambulatory 24-hour monitoring is recommended for the diagnosis of hypertension. Therefore intra-individual variability which is well documented in children could not be considered and may have led to an overestimation of BP values [35, 70].We adjusted only partially for multiple testing by choosing a significance level of 0.01 but no formal multiple testing correction was performed.As detailed dietary intake data was only available in a smaller subgroup and would not have reliably reflected dietary salt intake, we used the intake frequency of processed foods as a proxy for sodium intake because processed foods have shown to be the main source of salt [71].The large analysis group of >1200 children from 6 European countries as well as the longitudinal design and detailed phenotyping of the children are important strengths of our study. In all countries standardized protocols for data assessment, measurements and biosampling were applied at all survey waves and adherence to protocols was verified by a central quality control.ConclusionsOur results suggest that ARA adversely affects BP already in children and may contribute to the development of hypertension whereas n-3 PUFA exert BP lowering effects in thin and normal weight children. In overweight and obese children the detrimental effects of increased weight status may have overlaid the protective effects of n-3 fatty acids such that an unfavorable relation of EPA and DBP became apparent in this subgroup. Higher EPA, and especially higher DHA, combined with a healthier food pattern might be required to lower BP in both, thin/normal weight and overweight/obese children. Health interventions need to consider effect modification by weight status and should focus particularly on overweight and obese children who are more susceptible to elevated BP despite high n-3 PUFA levels.AcknowledgmentsWe wish to thank the IDEFICS/I.Family children and their parents for participating in these extensive examinations.Author ContributionsConceptualization: MW CB.Formal analysis: CB P.

Much attention has been paid to the mechanisms causing excessive insulin secretion in congenital hyperinsulinism [1–3] and insufficient secretion in monogenic neonatal diabetes [4, 5], and to possibly predictive β-cell defects in children at risk of type 1 diabetes [6]. In contrast, the secretory function of pancreatic β-cells has rarely been investigated in healthy infants or toddlers, largely for ethical reasons. Compared with islets from adolescents and adults, islets from young children display substantial evolving differences in cellular composition [7–11] and higher rates of β-cell replication [10, 11], but it is unclear how these features impact on their secretory function.Normal neonates display higher plasma insulin/glucose ratios than infants and children [12, 13], and show larger rises in plasma insulin concentration during iv infusion of amino acids than glucose [14, 15], two characteristics compatible with some “immaturity” of their β-cells. In 1–7 day-old newborns, iv injection of glucose was followed by a rapid increase of plasma insulin in the umbilical vein [16]. In peripheral blood, the amplitude of the rapid insulin response to iv glucose slightly augmented with body weight in children between 1 and 3 y [17], and with age between 4 and 10 y [18, 19], until occurrence of a marked increase at the time of puberty [20, 21]. In pre-pubertal children, the increase in plasma insulin was biphasic during hyperglycemic clamps [20, 22].Three-to-four decades ago, insulin secretion by the human fetal pancreas has been extensively studied in vitro. The consensus that emerged was that between 14 and 22 weeks of gestation, human fetal β-cells poorly responded to stimulation by glucose alone, but that a response could be unmasked by cAMP-raising agents, and that amino acids and sulfonylureas were more effective than glucose [23–28]. In contrast, in vitro studies of insulin secretion by the pancreas from normal neonates, infants or toddlers are very rare and somewhat contradictory. In islet-like cell clusters from two neonates (2 and 5 weeks) born at term, high glucose induced a rapid release of insulin with little second phase except when theophylline was added to increase cAMP [29]. Islets isolated from one 6-month-old infant responded to high glucose by a biphasic secretion of insulin [30]. Fragments of unaffected pancreas from infants with focal forms of congenital hyperinsulinism were found to secrete insulin in a qualitatively similar way to islets isolated from healthy adult organ donors [31]. Conversely, a recent study of islets isolated from 3 infant organ donors reported poor insulin secretion in response to glucose and KCl, and rapid loss of function compared with adult islets [32]. In this paper, we report a detailed characterization of the dynamics and regulation of insulin secretion by islets isolated from 5 infant and toddler organ donors.MethodsDuring a previous in vitro study of insulin secretion by islets from normal adult donors [33], we received islets isolated from the pancreas of 5 young children (11–36 months of age) referred to the transplantation Unit of the Medical Faculty of the University of Louvain through the Eurotransplant Network. The study was conducted within the framework of programs of basic research and islet transplantation approved by the Ethics Committee of our Institution (UCL-HIA-001, authorization 2001/79) and consent was given by the donors’ parents. The procedures of islet isolation and culture, and the technique of islet perifusion used to characterize insulin secretion were identical to those reported for adult islets [33]. Characteristics of the donors and of their isolated islets are given in Table 1. Although the group of donors includes both infants and toddlers, only the term “infant” will be used subsequently for the sake of simplicity.

Characteristics of infant donors and of their isolated islets.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165961.t001In brief, after culture in RPMI medium containing 5mmol/l glucose for about 38 h, similar portions of each islet preparation were transferred into perifusion chambers and perifused with a bicarbonate-buffered salt-balanced solution supplemented with glucose and test agents as required [33]. Because individual islets were not hand-picked and counted before transfer into chambers, the islet number used in each experiment was estimated by dividing the total amount of received islets (determined with islet purity after dithizone staining of a preparation sample) by the number of chambers [34]. Depending on the donor, 125–335 islets were used per perifusion chamber. To normalize results, islets were recovered from the chambers at the end of experiments and insulin was extracted in acid-ethanol [35]. Insulin was measured in effluent fractions collected every 2-min and in extracts. Fractional insulin secretion rate was then calculated as the percentage of insulin content secreted per minute, which is independent of differences in islet number between experiments [33,34]. Most data are presented as fractional insulin secretion rates (means ± SE). A stimulation index (ratio of stimulated to basal secretion rates) was also calculated in some experiments.Results in infant islets were compared with those previously obtained in adult islets that were isolated, purified, counted, cultured and eventually perifused in exactly the same way and over the same time period [33]. Characteristics of both groups of islet preparations were similar: purity averaged 76% (50–95) in infants and 68% (30–95) in adults; viability averaged 89% (85–95) in infants and 87% (70–93) in adults; culture duration averaged 38 h (32–60) for infant islets and 46 h (28–76) for adult islets. The dynamics of insulin secretion by adult islets have previously been published [33] and are not reproduced here. However, some results obtained with these adult islets were recalculated to permit comparison of the magnitude of insulin secretion by adult and infant islets. The statistical significance of differences between both groups was assessed by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test, with a threshold at P<0.05.ResultsIslet insulin contentThe insulin content of islets from infants was estimated by summing insulin secreted during experiments and insulin extracted from islets at the end of experiments. Values for the five individual cases are given in Table 1. Their average of 13.8 ± 1.9 ng insulin per islet is not different from the average content of 16 preparations of adult islets studied over the same time period (14.4 ± 1.4 ng) [33].Concentration-dependency of glucose-induced insulin secretionStepwise increases in the glucose concentration progressively increased insulin secretion in infant islets (Fig 1A and 1B). Alone, 1mmol/l glucose (G1) was ineffective (compared to G0), G3 doubled insulin secretion in two preparations (11 and 36 months), and G5 was stimulatory in all preparations (Fig 1A). The secretion rate then kept increasing up to G15 with hardly any further change above. Switching from G20 to G30 transiently decreased insulin secretion in 3 out of 5 preparations. When the glucose concentration was lowered from G10 to G1 (at 150 min), insulin secretion rapidly returned to basal rates. In contrast, lowering from G30 to G7 (at 240 min) was initially followed by a transient increase (off-response) (Fig 1A). The pattern of these changes in insulin secretion, including the unexplained off-response, was similar in the 5 islet preparations (S1 Fig) and is virtually identical to that previously observed in adult islets [33]. When the perifusion medium was supplemented with 1 μmol/l forskolin to increase islet cAMP levels, qualitatively similar but quantitatively larger responses were observed (Fig 1B). These experiments thus showed that the glucose-dependency of insulin secretion by islets from human infants was similar without or with forskolin (Fig 1C), with a threshold at G3-G4, half-maximal stimulation between G7 and G10, and maximum stimulation slightly above G15.

Concentration-dependency of glucose-induced insulin secretion in perifused islets from human infants.(A and B) The concentration of glucose (G in mmol/l) was increased and decreased as indicated, but the islets were not exposed to the whole range of concentrations. One group of islets was perifused in G0 for 60 min before the glucose concentration was increased stepwise to G10 and eventually decreased to G1 at 150 min. Another group from the same preparation was perifused in G7 for 60 min before the glucose concentration was increased stepwise to G30 and eventually decreased to G7. Insulin secretion rates in G7 and G10 from the two series, run in parallel, were similar and therefore averaged to obtain the full dose curve for each of the five islet preparations. Parallel experiments were done in the absence (A) or presence (B) of 1 μmol/l forskolin (Fk) in islets from the five infants. (C) Concentration-dependency curves expressed as percentages of insulin secretion rates in G30. Values are means ± SE for the five infant cases. (D) Total insulin secretion (without and with forskolin) was calculated between 0 and 240 min and is shown for each of the five infant cases identified by their age in months. Columns show means ± SE for the five infant cases and for previously reported results with 8 preparations of adult islets [33].              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165961.g001Total insulin secretion over the 240 min of stimulation by glucose alone or with forskolin is shown for each of the five cases in Fig 1D. Compared with adult islets previously tested with a similar protocol [33], infant islets secreted a smaller proportion of their insulin reserves when stimulated with glucose alone (3.9 ± 1.0% versus 11.5 ±1.2% in 4h, P< 0.01), but the difference was markedly attenuated (17.0 ± 1.5% versus 23.4 ± 2.9% in 4h, NS) in the presence of forskolin. Indeed, raising cAMP produced a greater amplification of the insulin response to glucose in infant (4.4-fold) than adult islets (2.0-fold).Dynamics of insulin secretionStimulation of infant islets by a rapid switch from G1 to G15 induced biphasic insulin secretion (Fig 2A). Opening KATP channels with diazoxide abolished insulin secretion, whereas subsequent closure of the channels with tolbutamide completely reversed the inhibition, and addition of forskolin strongly amplified the secretory response. Complete reversibility of the stimulation was observed on returning to G1 alone (Fig 2A). This pattern of insulin secretion was observed in all five preparations, independently of donor age (S2 Fig). The presence of forskolin during the whole experiment augmented the amplitude of first phase (~2-fold) and second phase (~3-fold) of the response to G15 without changing the time course or altering the inhibition by diazoxide and stimulation by tolbutamide. Simultaneous withdrawal of diazoxide and return to G1 was followed by a transient off-response in 3/5 preparations (Fig 2B) (S2 Fig).

Dynamics of glucose-induced insulin secretion in perifused islets from human infants.The experiments also tested the effects of drugs opening (diazoxide) or closing (tolbutamide) KATP channels and of an increase in islet cAMP by forskolin. (A) The concentration of glucose was changed between 1 and 15 mmol/l (G1, G15), and diazoxide (Dz, 100 μmol/l), tolbutamide (Tolb, 100 μmol/l), and forskolin (Fk, 1 μmol/l) were added and withdrawn as indicated. (B) The whole experiment was performed in the presence of 1 μmol/l forskolin. Values are means ± SE for the five infant cases. (C and D) Glucose-induced insulin secretion was expressed as a stimulation index (ratio G15/G1) during first phase (2–10 min) and second phase (20–30 min) of the response. Mean and individual values for islets from the five infants (identified by age in months) are compared with mean values for 14–16 islet preparations from normal adults [33].              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165961.g002The dynamics of insulin secretion in infant islets (Fig 2A and 2B) were thus similar to those previously reported for adult islets, but fractional rates of secretion were lower [33]. Total insulin secreted between 0 and 30 min averaged 1.10 ± 0.16% versus 2.66 ± 0.31% in G15 alone (P<0.01), and 3.16 ± 0.54% versus 4.40 ± 0.48% (NS) in G15 with forskolin. However, the relative amplitude of the stimulation by G15 (stimulation index) was not different in infant and adult islets during either first or second phase of the response (Fig 2C). This similarity of stimulation index in face of lower fractional rates of secretion in stimulated infant islets is explained by lower basal secretion rates in G1.Stimulation by amino acids and metabolic amplification of insulin secretionAddition of a mixture of leucine and glutamine to a medium containing G3 and forskolin induced biphasic insulin secretion, which was reversibly abolished by omission of CaCl2 from the medium (Fig 3A) (S3 Fig). The dynamics of the changes were the same as in adult islets [33] but, again, total insulin secretion over 30 min of stimulation was lower (1.48 ± 0.22% versus 3.46 ± 0.69%, P<0.05). Yet, the stimulation index was similar because of lower basal secretion rates in infant islets (Fig 3B).

Effects of amino acids and tolbutamide on insulin secretion in perifused islets from human infants.(A) The experiments were done in the presence of 3 mmol/l glucose (G3) and 1 μmol/l forskolin (Fk) throughout. Leucine and glutamine (5 mmol/l each) were added at 0 min. Between 30 and 50 min, CaCl2 was omitted and 100 μmol/l EGTA was added. (B) Insulin secretion induced by leucine + glutamine was expressed as a stimulation index for the whole response (0–30 min). Mean and individual values for islets from four infants (identified by age in months) are compared with mean values for 5 islet preparations from normal adults [33]. (C) Three pulses of 10 mmol/l arginine (Arg) were applied in G3 alone, G3 + 25 μmol/l tolbutamide (Tolb 25), or G15 + Tolb 25. (D) Islets were fully depolarized by 500 μmol/l tolbutamide (Tolb 500) in 1 mmol/l glucose (G1). The glucose concentration was then increased to 15 mmol/l (G15) between 30 and 70 min, and forskolin (1 μmol/l) was eventually added to G1 (in 3/5 cases only). Values are means ± SE for islet preparations from 4 (A, B and C) or 5 infants (D).              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165961.g003A 10-min pulse of arginine (10 mmol/l) slightly increased insulin secretion in infant islets perifused in G3 (Fig 3C). Tolbutamide (25 μmol/l) augmented (~3-fold) the secretion rate in G3 and amplified (~3-fold) the response to arginine, which became very large in the presence of G15. These amplifications of arginine-induced insulin secretion involve both augmentation of cytosolic Ca2+ (tolbutamide) and augmentation of the response to Ca2+ (glucose) [36]. They are qualitatively indistinguishable from those occurring in adult islets [33]. However, fractional secretion rates were lower in infant islets; for example, total insulin secreted during stimulation with tolbutamide and arginine in G3 (30 to 80 min) averaged 0.80 ± 0.11% versus 1.90 ± 0.24% in adult islets, P<0.01).Metabolic amplification of insulin secretion can be evidenced by increasing the concentration of glucose when all KATP channels in β-cells are closed by a high concentration of tolbutamide [37]. As shown in Fig 3D, 500 μmol/l tolbutamide rapidly increased insulin secretion in G1, and a subsequent switch to G15 more than doubled the secretion rate in a reversible manner. Addition of forskolin at the end of the experiment was also able to amplify insulin secretion (Fig 3D). The pattern of the response to tolbutamide and of its amplification by high glucose was similar to that in adult islets [33], but total insulin secretion induced by tolbutamide in G1 (0 to 30 min) was smaller (0.63 ± 0.15% versus 2.12 ± 0.40% in adult islets, P<0.01).DiscussionIn vitro studies of insulin secretion by β-cells from normal young children are extremely rare owing to the exceptional availability of the necessary material. This rarity at least partly originates from the idea that children islets are suboptimal for transplantation and hence infrequently isolated from very young organ donors [30].Our study shows that the characteristics of insulin secretion by islets from normal infants are similar to those previously defined in similarly treated islets from normal adults [33]. Qualitatively, infant islets responded like adult islets to stimulation by glucose, tolbutamide, forskolin, arginine and the combination of leucine and glutamine, and to inhibition by diazoxide and extracellular CaCl2 omission. This similarity included the biphasic pattern of glucose-induced insulin secretion and the dynamics of the responses to other stimuli. Amplification of insulin secretion by glucose when all KATP channels are closed by a sulfonylurea was operative as in adult islets, as was amplification of arginine-induced insulin secretion by tolbutamide and by glucose [33].Morphometric studies of the intact pancreas have shown that the average diameter of islets is smaller in children than adults [10, 11], but we have not verified whether a similar difference characterized the preparations of isolated islets that we studied. Anyhow, it is unlikely that the insulin content of infant islets was found similar to that of adult islets because of our use of larger islets from infants than adults. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were expressed relative to islet insulin content, which is independent of differences in islet size and number. Quantitative differences were found between insulin responses of infant and adult islets, but their detection depended on the way of calculation. Although islet insulin content was not different, fractional insulin secretion rates were lower in infant than adult islets irrespective of the stimulus. Yet, these differences did not reflect poor responsiveness of infant β-cells because basal fractional insulin secretion rates were also lower, so that fold-changes above baseline (stimulation index) were similar to those in adult islets. That means that infant β-cells secrete a lower proportion of their insulin content than adult islets under basal and stimulated conditions. It is tempting to relate that peculiarity to the low needs of insulin when, well before puberty, target tissues are still highly sensitive to insulin action. However, it is uncertain whether the elusive mechanisms permitting β-cells to adapt their secretory function to insulin sensitivity in vivo are long-lasting and still operative in vitro after 36h of islet culture. During growth and body weight increase, two factors may underlie the augmentation of insulin production in vivo: an increase in the secretory response of individual β-cells and an expansion of β-cell mass. This expansion starts soon after birth [9], continues up to ~5 years of age [10] and reaches ~4-5-fold according to estimations [10] and direct measurements [7]. Our observations of a normal secretory function in infant islets indicate that the relatively small proportion (<2%) of proliferating β-cells in these islets [10, 11, 38, 39] has little functional influence on the bulk of other β-cells.Many β-cells are scattered single or form small clusters in the pancreas of neonates, but most of them reside in well-structured islets after 6 months of age [7, 10, 11, 40]. Yet, infant and adult islets still differ in their cellular composition. Whereas the percentage of β-cells is similar, somatostatin cells are relatively more numerous than glucagon cells during infancy, and the proportions are reversed in adulthood [7, 9, 11]. These changes in islet cell proportions during infancy may impact on β-cell function through paracrine mechanisms [41, 42]. Fractional insulin secretion rates were 2.5 to 3-fold lower in infant than adult islets when glucose was used alone, but only 1.4-fold lower (non-significant) when glucose was combined with forskolin to increase β-cell cAMP. These observations indirectly suggest that the lower responses observed in the absence of forskolin might be due to lower basal levels of cAMP in infant β-cells. If direct measurements confirmed the hypothesis, the smaller proportion of glucagon cells and greater proportion of somatostatin cells in infant than adult islets would be a plausible mechanistic explanation. Whereas low cAMP production, a characteristic of fetal β-cells [27, 28], may extend to the first years of postnatal life, no specific anomaly in the action of glucose was detected. The difference in fractional insulin secretion rates between infant and adult islets was not greater during glucose stimulation than during stimulation with tolbutamide, either alone or combined with arginine. In addition, the sigmoidal concentration-dependency curve of glucose-induced insulin secretion in infant islets was close to that in adult islets [33, 34], with a threshold around G3 and maximum stimulation at or just above G15. Only the half-maximally effective glucose concentration was slightly higher in infant than adult islets (G 7–8.5 versus G 6.5–7). These adult-type responses to glucose indirectly indicate that metabolism of the sugar is also controlled by glucokinase rather than hexokinase-I [28, 43, 44] in infant β-cells.One recent study compared in vitro β-cell function in islets from adults and from 3 infants (2.5, 4 and 19 months of age) [32]. Using hand-picked islets after 24-48h of culture, the authors reported that infant islets contained very low amounts of insulin (10% of adults) and poorly secreted it upon perifusion with high glucose or KCl (reduced stimulation index). They attributed these defects to insufficient production of metabolic signals (lower ATP/ADP and NADPH/NADP ratios) and reduced availability of exocytotic proteins. They also observed that, unlike adult islets, infant islets rapidly lost their functional phenotype during culture [32]. It is unclear why these results so markedly contrast with the excellent functioning of our five preparations of infant islets. Good stimulation of insulin secretion by glucose was also observed in static incubations of islets from young donors (0.5–17 year-old) [30]. We previously characterized the defects of insulin secretion by β-cells from infants (2–11 months) with congenital hyperinsulinism secondary to inactivating mutations in one of the subunits of KATP channels [31]. In the focal form of the disease, the lesion was surgically resected with a surrounding rim of unaffected pancreas, which was used as control tissue. Although the experiments were done with suboptimal preparations (digested fragments of pancreas), all changes in insulin secretion measured in control tissue [31] were qualitatively similar to those we report here with isolated islets. There was however one quantitative difference: both basal and stimulated fractional rates of insulin secretion were lower in isolated islets than fragments, probably because fewer β-cells were damaged in isolated islets.In conclusion, islets isolated from 11–36 month-old children secrete insulin virtually like adult islets when tested in vitro. The only significant difference is quantitative, not qualitative. Whereas the dynamics of their responses to an array of stimuli and inhibitors are similar, infant islets consistently secrete lower proportions of their insulin stores than adult islets, a difference that is attenuated by cAMP. Yet, because unstimulated secretion rates are also lower, the amplitude of their responses above baseline (stimulation index) is not reduced. Human β-cells therefore have reached functional maturity by the age of 1 year, before expansion of their mass is complete. Closer timing of postnatal β-cell maturation and elucidation of its mechanisms will require studies of islets from infants between birth and the age of 1 year, particularly around weaning [45]. Ideally, functional and genetic approaches should be combined to determine whether increased expression or silencing of the same genes as in rodent β-cells [45–47] impact on the secretory process. The endeavor will be challenging owing to the rarity of infant donors, but should prove valuable for the numerous laboratories currently attempting to derive well-functioning β-cells from human pluripotent stem cells.Supporting InformationS1 Fig. Concentration-dependency of glucose-induced insulin secretion in perifused islets from human infants.Individual responses of the five preparations of infant islets whose mean response is shown in Fig 1.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0165961.s001(PDF)S2 Fig. Dynamics of glucose-induced insulin secretion in perifused islets from human infants.Individual responses of the five preparations of infant islets whose mean response is shown in Fig 2.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0165961.s002(PDF)S3 Fig. Effects of amino acids and tolbutamide on insulin secretion in perifused islets from human infants.Individual responses of the five preparations of infant islets whose mean response is shown in Fig 3.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0165961.s003(PDF)AcknowledgmentsWe are grateful to Dr. D.

Given that the presence of depressive symptoms is closely related to clinical levels of depression, there has been great interest in understanding the distribution of depressive symptoms in the general population [2, 3].Several recent studies based on large sample sizes have shown that total depressive symptom scores in the general population follow an exponential pattern, except for the lower end of the distribution. In a data analysis on nearly 10,000 respondents to the British National Household Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, Melzer et al. observed that an exponential curve provided the best fit for total depressive and neurotic symptom scores on the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) [4, 5]. The authors of the present study have similarly observed that the right tail of the distribution of total depressive symptom scores on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) follows an exponential curve, based on data on nearly 25,000 respondents to a national survey of the Japanese population [6]. A similar study also involving a large sample of Japanese employees further supported the exponential pattern of CES-D scores [7].Although several recent studies based on large sample sizes have shown that total depressive symptom scores in the general population follow an exponential pattern, Melzer et al. has pointed out that total depressive symptomatic scores do not follow an exponential curve at specific levels of depressive symptom scores. Using the CIS-R, Meltzer et al. reported that total neurotic symptoms and depressive scores do not follow an exponential curve for symptom scores below 3 [5]. Furthermore, we performed a simulation study on depressive symptom scores modeled after the CIS-R and we found that the distribution of the simulated total depressive symptom scores did not follow an exponential pattern at the lower end of the distribution[8]. However, little research has been conducted on how non-exponential patterns occur at the lowest end of the distribution.The CES-D allows an individual to self-rate the frequency of a variety of depressive symptoms (sadness, fatigue, etc.) on a scale consisting of four possible responses: “rarely (less than 1 day),” “some (1 to 2 days),” “occasionally (3 to 4 days),” and “most of the time (5 to 7 days)” (Radloff, 1997). Recently, we have shown that responses to each of the 16 individual items related to negative affect symptoms on the CES-D tend to exhibit exponential patterns for “some” and “most” responses in the general population, while this pattern is not observed for “rarely” responses[9]. These findings seem to suggest that the non-exponential item response pattern at the level of “rarely” responses may be related to the non-exponential patterns of total depressive symptom scores at the lower end of the distribution. To verify this hypothesis, we investigated how depressive symptom items, each of which has a different probability of “rarely” response, contribute to the distribution of total depressive symptom scores.In the present study, we investigated the distribution of the sum of depressive symptom item scores in various combinations, using data from a large, cross-sectional national survey of the Japanese general population [10]. To assess the item responses in the range from “rarely” to “some,” we introduced a parameter r to denote the ratio of probability of “rarely” to the probability of “some.” According to the ranking of parameter r, the 16 negative items of the CES-D were grouped into combinations which consisted of 8 items each. Then, we compared the distributional patterns of the sum of 8 negative item scores on three combinations. Having confirmed that the distributional patterns of the sum of 8 negative item scores varied depending on the mean value of parameter r, the distributional patterns of the sum of 2 negative item scores, 4 negative items and 16 negative items were analyzed.The goal of the present study was to determine whether the item responses in the range from “rarely” to “some” contribute to the non-exponential pattern of total scores at the lower end of the distribution and to examine whether the sum of negative item scores approximate an exponential pattern, except for the lower end of the distribution.Materials & MethodsThe present study used data from the Active Survey of Health and Welfare (ASHW) conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare in 2000 [10]. The ASHW is an annual nationwide survey conducted by the Japanese Government to collect the data required for policymaking and health promotion, in compliance with the Statistics Act. A legal and ethical approval of the ASWH was granted by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. In 2000, the ASHW investigated depressive symptoms among a representative sample of the Japanese general population. To ensure that the sample was adequately representative, survey participants were selected from individuals aged 12 years and older, living across 300 communities in Japan. These communities were selected from 881,851 precincts identified in the 1995 Census using a stratified sampling design. The survey was conducted anonymously, and a verbal informed consent was obtained from all participants and legal guardians. The data and methods used in the survey have been described in detail in a previous report [10].The questionnaire was returned by 32,729 respondents, even though the response rate was not published by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare and Health. However, the response rates for similar surveys conducted 3 and 4 years before were 87.1% and 89.6%, respectively [11]. Therefore, we assumed the response rate for the ASWH survey to be higher than 80%. A total of 707 participants who returned a blank questionnaire were excluded from the analysis.The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare examined our research program and allowed us to perform a secondary analysis on the anonymized data from the ASWH, in compliance with the Japanese Statistics Act. The present study was approved in 2014 by the ethics committee of the Panasonic Health Center (approval number 2014–1). The authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.We excluded 1,394 respondents owing to the suspect validity of their responses (i.e., those who answered “rarely” or “most” for all items, regardless of the nature of the item). A total of 9,588 respondents were also excluded from the sample owing to missing information on one or more key study variables (i.e., depressive symptoms, age, sex). The final sample consisted of 21,040 respondents between 12 and 98 years of age (ages 12–19; N = 2457 [male; n = 1269], ages 20–29; N = 3748 [male; n = 1788], ages 30–39; N = 3761 [male; n = 1783], ages 40–49; N = 3629 [male; n = 1788], ages 50–59; N = 3569 [male; n = 1800], ages 60–69; N = 2253 [male; n = 1155], ages 70–79; N = 1161 [male; n = 517], ages 80–89; N = 412 [male; n = 108], ages 90–98; N = 50 [male; n = 15]).MeasuresDepressive symptoms were assessed using the Japanese version of the CES-D [12]. This 20-item scale assesses the frequency of a variety of depressive symptoms experienced within the previous week (0 = rarely or never—less than 1 day, 1 = some or little time –1–2 days, 2 = occasionally or a moderate amount of times –3–4 days, and 3 = most or all the time –5–7 days), yielding a total score of 0–60 [13]. Higher scores indicate greater psychological distress. The 20 items of the CES-D are generally grouped into the following four subscales: depressive mood (items 3, 6, 9, 10, 14, 17, and 18); somatic symptoms (items 1, 2, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 20); interpersonal relations (items 15 and 19); positive affect (items 4, 8, 12, and 16). The positive affect items are reverse-scored.In our previous work, we showed that the 16 negative items related to depressive mood, somatic symptoms, and interpersonal relations follow a common mathematical model, while the four items related to positive affect do not, suggesting that the items/symptoms associated with positive affect are not manifest variables of the unidimensional latent trait [9]. Thus, data on these 16 negative affect items were analyzed in the present study.Analysis procedureTo assess the item response in the range from “rarely” to “some,” the parameter r, which denotes the ratio of probability of “rarely” to the probability of “some,” was calculated for all the 16 negative items. A rank order was allocated according to the degree of parameter r. In addition, to assess the item response in the range from “some” to “occasionally,” the ratio of “some” to “occasionally” was calculated for all the 16 negative items. Using the parameter “r,” we compared the ratio of “rarely” to “some with the ratio of “some” to “occasionally.”The distributions of the sum of negative affect items in various combinations were analyzed using log-normal scales. The fitting curve for an exponential model was estimated using least square method. The distributional patterns of the sum of 8 negative items, 4 negative items 2 negative items, and 16 negative items were compared among the different combinations. JMP Version 11 for Windows (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used to calculate the descriptive statistics and the frequency distributions.ResultsCharacteristics of item responses of 16 depressive symptomsThe item responses for the 16 negative affect items and the calculated parameter r are shown in Table 1. The value of parameter r varied depending on each item (mean ± S.D. = 4.07 ± 3.34).

As shown in Fig 1B, the item responses for the 16 items showed a linear and parallel pattern between “some” and “most” using a log-normal scale, indicating that these 16 items exhibited an exponential pattern with the same parameter for this response level.

The high r group consists of any items from the first to the eighth in the rank order of r, the middle r group consists of any items from the fifth to the twelfth, and low r group consists of any items from the ninth to the sixteenth. The average of parameter r was 6.05 for the high r group, 3.33 for the middle r group, and 2.08 for the low r group.The distributions of the sum of 8 item scores for the three groups are shown in Fig 2A (high r group), Fig 2B (middle r group) and Fig 2C (low r group). While the distributions of the sum of 8 item scores for the three groups are commonly right-skewed, the frequencies of the zero score were different across groups.

While the distributions of the sum of 8 item scores for the three groups are commonly right-skewed, the frequencies of zero score were different across groups: The largest within the high r group (blue line), moderate within the middle r group (red line), and the smallest within the low r group (yellow line).              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165928.g002Using a log-normal scale, all three groups showed linear and parallel patterns from 0–8 points to 24 points, suggesting that the sum of 8 item scores for the three groups followed an exponential pattern, with similar rate parameter (Fig 3). Conversely, as indicated by the arrows in Fig 3, the three groups exhibited individual patterns at the lower end of the distribution. While the distribution for the high r group showed higher frequencies compared to those predicted from the exponential pattern (blue arrow), the distribution for the low r group exhibited lower frequencies compared to those predicted from the exponential pattern (yellow arrow). Furthermore, the distribution for the middle r group exhibited frequencies close to those predicted from the exponential pattern.

Consistent with log-normal scale findings, exponential curve fitting showed a markedly higher coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.99) with similar rate parameter (-0.26 ~ -0.29).Distributional patterns of the sum of 4 negative itemsTo confirm the reproducibility of the findings observed for the sum of 8 items, we examined the distributions of the sum of 4 item scores. According to the parameter r ranking order, the 16 negative items of the CES-D were grouped into four combinations: high r group (item 10, item 15, item 17, and item 19), middle high r group (item 2, item 3, item 14, and item 18), middle low r group (item 6, item 11, item 13, and item 20), and low r group (item 1, item 5, item 7, and item 9). The high r group consists of any items from the first to the fourth in the rank order of r, the middle high r group consists of any items from the fifth to the eighth, the middle low r group consists of any items from the ninth to the twelfth, and the low r group consists of any items from the thirteenth to the sixteenth. The average of parameter r was 8.12 for the high r group, 3.98 for the middle high r group, 2.02 for the middle low r group, and 1.50 for the low r group.The distributions of the sum of 4 item scores for the four groups are shown in Fig 4. While all distributions of the four groups are right-skewed, the low r group (Fig 4D) exhibited a plateau between point 1 and point 3.

Exponential curve fitting showed a markedly higher coefficient of determination in all four groups (R2 = 0.99) with similar rate parameter (-0.41 ~ -0.52).Distributional patterns of the sum of 2 negative itemsFinally, we examined the distributions of the sum of 2 item scores. According to the parameter r ranking order, the 16 negative items of the CES-D were grouped into four combinations: high r group (item 15 and item 17), middle high r group (item 3 and item 14), middle low r group (item 6 and item 11), and low r group (item 1 and item 7). The high r group consists of the first and second item in the ranking order of parameter r, the middle high r group consists of the fifth and sixth, the middle low r group consists of the eleventh and twelfth, and the low r group consists of fifteenth and sixteenth. The average of parameter r was 10.43 for the high r group, 4.44 for the middle high r group, 2.24 for the middle low r group, and 1.31 for the low r group.The distributions of the sum of 2 item scores for the four groups are shown in Fig 6. While the distributions of the sum of 2 item scores for the four groups are right-skewed, the highest frequency of the zero score was different across groups.

Consistent with log-normal scale findings, although exponential curve fitting showed a higher coefficient of determination in all four groups (0.97–0.99), the rate parameter of the sum of 2 items (-0.62 ~-0.93) was not very similar compared to those of the sum of 4 items and 8 items.Distributional patterns of the total scores of 16 negative itemsFinally, we examined the distributions of the total scores of 16 items. The average of parameter r was 4.07 for the 16 negative items. The distribution of the total scores of 16 items is right-skewed (Fig 8A). Using a log-normal scale (Fig 8B), the total scores of 16 items showed linear patterns from zero points to 48 points.

Consistent with log-normal scale findings, exponential curve fitting showed a markedly higher coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.99).DiscussionThe aim of the present study was to determine whether the item responses in the range from “rarely” to “some” contribute to the non-exponential pattern of total scores at the lower end of the distribution. The main findings of this study are as follows: (1) regardless of the choice of the items, the sum of negative item scores approximate an exponential pattern, except for the lower end of the distribution; (2) at the lower end of the distribution, the distributional pattern of the sum of the item scores varies depending on the parameter r of the chosen items, with the high parameter r group exhibiting higher frequencies compared to those expected from the exponential pattern, whereas the low parameter r group exhibits lower frequencies compared to those expected from the exponential pattern.The sum of negative item scores approximated an exponential pattern, except for the lower end of the distributionOur findings indicate that the sum of negative item scores in various conditions approximates an exponential pattern, except for the lower end of the distribution. The reason why the sum of negative affect item scores approximates exponential patterns irrespective of their combination could be explained by a theory suggesting that negative affect items follow a unidimensional latent trait [6, 9]. According to this theory, negative affect items are manifest variables influenced by a unidimensional latent trait of depressive symptoms, and the latent traits of negative affect items follow an exponential distribution [7]. Furthermore, the simulation study using an ordinal scale model has confirmed that the sum of the ordinal scale items approximates a pattern similar to that of the latent trait distribution, except for the lower end of the distribution [8]. Taken together, these observations imply that the sum of negative affect item scores, using ordinal scales, approximates an exponential pattern in any combination.Although the results of our study support the hypothesis that the latent traits of negative affect items follow an exponential distribution, the mechanism responsible for the exponential distribution of the latent traits is not clear. In general, an exponential distribution is observed where individual variability and total stability are organized together [14]. With respect to individual variability, personal mood and the related symptoms are generally the variables of interest. With regard to total stability, several studies have demonstrated the stability of depressive symptom scores in the general population [6, 15].Analyzing the data of the second British National Survey of Psychiatry morbidity, Bebbington et al. demonstrated that selected affective symptoms scores related to paranoia followed an almost perfect exponential distribution [16]. From the viewpoint of the unidimensional latent trait, affective symptoms scores related to paranoia might have followed an exponential distribution because the items themselves were chosen from negative affective items. Further research is necessary to verify this speculation.The rate parameters of the exponential models of the sum of negative affect item scores of 2 negative items, 4 negative items, 8 negative items and 16 negative items were -0.62 to -0.93, -0.41 to -0.52, -0.26 to -0.29, -0.14, respectively. The estimated parameters were similar across the groups with same number of items and increased as the number of summed items increased. These results suggest that the rate parameters of the exponential model of summed scores are associated with the number of items. Further mathematical explanation is necessary to elucidate the mechanism of the rate parameter variance.The sum of negative affect item scores exhibited a different distribution pattern at the lower end of the distributionOur findings indicate that the distributional patterns of the sum of negative affect items varied depending on the parameter r of the selected negative items. The sum of negative affect items with high values of r exhibited higher frequencies compared to those predicted from the exponential pattern of total scores, whereas the sum of negative affect items with low values of r exhibited lower frequencies compared to those predicted from the exponential pattern of total scores.The conditions that enable such findings can be speculated on. Whereas the sum of negative affect items in any combination approximates exponential patterns, with the same parameter, the number of subjects that corresponds to the range of the exponential pattern is different depending on the combinations of the items. The combinations of negative affect items with high values of r have a relatively small number in the range of the exponential pattern, whereas the combinations of negative affect items with low values of r have a relatively large number in the area of the exponential pattern. Since the total number of subjects is the same in all combinations, the sum of negative items with high values of r exhibits a relatively large number at the lowest end of the scores, whereas the sum of negative affect items with low values of r exhibits a relatively small number in the range of the exponential pattern, resulting in a different distribution pattern at the lowest end of the scores, depending on the mean value of r. It is worth noticing that, when the mean value of r is close to the ratio of “some” to “occasionally,” the distribution of the sum of negative affect items becomes similar to the predicted exponential pattern at the lowest end of the scores (Fig 3, red line, Fig 8B). These results suggest that the probability of “rarely” is a key index to predict the distributional pattern of the sum of negative affect items.Analyzing the data of the British National Household Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, Meltzer et al. reported that there is a clear divergence between the actual data and the fitted exponential curve at the lower end of the distribution [5]. Since the CIS-R employs a binary method of item scoring (0–1: absence or presence), the mean probability of “absence” in item responses may contribute to the divergence of the actual data from the fitted exponential curve at the lowest end of the scores. In fact, according to our estimation, using data of the British National Survey of Psychiatry Morbidity, the mean probability of “absence” in CIS-R items (90.1%) is much higher than the probability of “rarely” in middle r groups, in the present study, and the actual data at the lower end of the distribution are higher than those predicted from the fitted exponential curve [15, 17].Strengths and limitationsThe present study has some limitations. First, although we evaluated whether the sum of the item scores approximates an exponential distribution on a log-normal scale, we did not perform an analysis based on other mathematical models. In general, the most important part of model evaluation is testing whether the model fits empirical data better than other models. However, to the best of our knowledge, no other mathematical models for the sum of item scores have been reported so far. Thus, using graphical analysis and curve fitting, we performed the analysis limited to an exponential model. Future studies can evaluate the comparative fit of other models to our empirical data as reported in S1 File. Second, survey participants did not receive a standard psychiatric interview and the diagnosis associated with a structured interview. The present study did not encompass a diagnosis of depressive symptomsConversely, there is a methodological advantage in the present investigation. The sample was representative of the Japanese general population, which reduced selection bias. In addition, the large sample size (N = 21,040) enabled us to elucidate patterns in the distributions of depressive symptom items. Finally, the present study provides important information regarding the distribution of the sum of negative affect items, indicating that he parameter r of the chosen items could predict the distributional pattern of the sum of depressive symptom items in the general population. The degree to which the present findings can be generalized to empirical data is not clear yet, though further examination is warranted.Supporting InformationS1 File.

Interestingly, regardless of the platform used, there appears to be a disproportionate benefit of cellular therapy on functional improvement in relation to the number of injected stem cells that remain in the heart or transdifferentiate into cardiac myocytes in large animal models of cardiovascular disease [1–5]. This has given rise to the notion that many therapies work through a paracrine signaling mechanism that stimulates endogenous myocyte and capillary formation while at the same time, inhibiting fibrosis [6–9].Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) have been advanced to clinical trials as a platform for cardiopoietic cell therapy. They have been shown to decrease scar size, increase viable myocardium, and improve regional function of infarcted myocardium at 1 year post-treatment in the phase 1/2 CArdiosphere-Derived aUtologous StemCElls to reverse ventricUlar dySfunction (CADUCEUS) clinical trial[10]. While they stimulate regeneration, angiogenesis, and functional improvement in infarcted myocardium [11, 12], these benefits likely occur by indirect mechanisms. This conclusion is based on the fact that most of the newly regenerated myocardium and vasculature are from cells of endogenous origin [2, 13] and the beneficial effects of CDCs persist long after the injected cells have been cleared by the host [14]. Thus, paracrine factors released by CDCs have become candidates for effecting cardiac repair.Recent reports indicate that extracellular membrane vesicles participate in paracrine signaling, including the transfer of functional proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs. Exosomes are bi-lipid membrane vesicles with diameters of 40-100nm that originate in the late endosomal compartment within intracellular multivesicular bodies (MVBs). After fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane, pools of exosomes are released into the extracellular environment and function as vectors of cell to cell communication. In support of their role in preventing postinfarcrion LV remodeling, injection of a large number of highly purified stem cell-derived exosomes directly into the myocardium reduced infarct size and prevented the decline in systolic function due to left ventricular remodeling following myocardial infarction [15–19]. Developing an approach to inhibit exosome release from stem cells on a chronic basis is required to dissociate their importance from paracrine factors released in an exosome independent manner.Neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) has been shown to contribute to exosome secretion by triggering the budding of exosomes into MVBs [20], and shRNA blockade of nSMase2 inhibits the release of exosomes from human macrophages (THP-1 cells) [21]. In models of myocardial infarction, the contribution of paracrine secreted CDC exosomes to functional improvement of the heart, their mechanism of uptake, and how this may be targeted remain important parameters. Accordingly, we have taken a genetic approach to selectively block exosome release by shRNA KD of nSMase2. Our findings support a role of exosomes on endogenous cardiac repair but demonstrate a divergent effect among specific resident cardiac cell types.Materials and MethodsHuman CDC CultureFollowing written informed consent, endomyocardial biopsies from the right atrial appendage were obtained from four adult patients undergoing on pump CABG at Buffalo General Medical Center under approved Institutional Review Board protocols. Cardiosphere-derived cells were grown as previously described from each patient [2]. In brief, heart biopsies were minced into small fragments, washed, and briefly digested with type IV collagenase for 60 minutes at 37°C. Explants were then cultured on 20μg/ml fibronectin-coated dishes. A layer of stromal-like cells and population of small, round, phase-bright cells migrated out to surround the explants. Once confluent, the cells surrounding the explants were harvested by gentle enzymatic digestion. These cardiosphere-forming cells were seeded at ~ 1×105 cells/mL on low attachment dishes in cardiosphere medium (20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, pen/strep 100 μg/ml, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 0.1 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco medium). Cardiospheres formed and began to slowly grow in suspension. After 4–6 days in culture, when sufficient in size and number, free-floating cardiospheres were harvested by aspirating them along with media. Detached cardiospheres were then plated on fibronectin-coated flasks where they attached to the culture surface and formed monolayers of “Cardiosphere-Derived Cells” (CDCs) [11]. CDCs were subsequently passaged by trypsinization and splitting at a 1:8 ratio. Up to 100 million CDCs developed within 4–6 weeks of the time that the original cardiac biopsies were obtained. Cells were characterized by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry with hematopoietic (CD45, cKit, CD133), mesenchymal (CD90, CD105) and cardiac (GATA4, Nkx2.5, and cTnI) markers.Human Cardiac Fibroblast CultureCardiac fibroblasts were isolated from right atrial appendage endomycoardial tissue biopsies obtained as described above. Cells were isolated and cultured according to previously described methods [22]. Discoidin domain receptor (DDR)2 (mouse monoclonal, Abcam), a collagen receptor shown to be expressed specifically in cardiac fibroblasts but not myocytes, endothelial cells or vascular smooth muscle cells, was chosen for ICC validation of our primary cell line [23–25] and cultures showed near 100% purity.Mouse Primary Cardiomyocyte CultureAll animal experiments were performed according to protocol approved by the University at Buffalo Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Day 1–3 neonatal mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and their hearts were dissected. Tissue digestion was performed using the Pierce Primary Cardiomyocyte Isolation Kit (ThermoScientific). For each experiment, dissociated cardiomyocytes were pooled from 10 neonatal mouse hearts (total yield approximated 12x106 cells). Isolation and plating of cardiomyocytes was accomplished within two hours of animal euthanization to obtain high cell yield and reproducible viability. Cells were plated at 4.0 x 104 cells per 96 well or 5.0 x 105 per 24 well. Cardiomyocyte purity was over 80% at one week with strong synchronous contractions of cells in the wells visualized by phase contrast microscopy after 3 days in culture.Immunocytochemistry and Flow Cytometry CharacterizationCDCs were dissociated to single cell suspension by incubation with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA and resuspended in DMEM/F12 with HEPES (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (FACS Staining Medium). They were incubated with conjugated antibody at 1:10 dilution for 1 h at 4°C prior flow cytometry analysis (BD FACSCalibur). Antibodies used include CD105 (mouse monoclonal, Abcam), CD90 (mouse monocolonal, BioLegend), CD45 (mouse monocolonal, AbD Serotec), mouse IgG1-FITC (R&D Systems), and mouse IgG1-APC (Miltenyi Biotec). For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained with primary antibodies GATA4 (goat polyclonal, R&D Systems), Nkx2.5 (goat polyclonal, R&D Systems), and cardiac troponin I (mouse monoclonal, Abcam). Primary antibodies were used at a 1:100 dilution. Alexa Fluor conjugated 488 or 555 donkey anti-mouse, goat or rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were added at a dilution of 1:500 for 1 hour at room temperature. Fixed cultures were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma). Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted fluorescence microscope.shRNAi Lentiviral Generation and Creation of hCDC nSMase2 Knockdown LineshRNA targeting human nSMase2 (National Center for Biotechnology Information Nucleotide database accession code NM_018667) constructed with the lentiviral vector pLKO.1 (Addgene), and the scrambled shRNA LV control vector, were generously provided by Dr. Zhenghong Yuan [21]. We subsequently generated nSMase2 and scrambled lentiviruses using triple transfection of the lentiviral backbone with helper plasmids pLP/VSVG (Invitrogen) and psPAX2 (AddGene, #12260) into 293T cells using Fugene HD (Promega). Viral supernatants were collected in OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) at 48 and 72 hours and yielded a titer of at least 106 GFP-transducing U/ml. Human CDCs were transduced at 1 MOI in the presence of polybrene (Sigma) and stable lines selected with puromycin (Sigma) at a concentration of 2μg/ml for 72 hours. Confirmation of nSMase2 knockdown was confirmed at P4, corresponding to the passage at which all experiments (exosome production and co-culture assays) were performed.Media Conditioning and Exosome PurificationSimilarly to previously described methods by other groups, exosomes were harvested from CDCs at P4 [15]. This passage also corresponds to the passage of CDCs transplanted into our porcine model of hibernating myocardium [1, 2]. As a control, we also isolated exosomes from normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) at P4. 1.3 x 106 CDCs and NHDFs were conditioned in media containing exosome free serum (System Biosciences) for 48 hours in T75 flasks. Media was then centrifuged at 3,000xg for 15 minutes to remove cellular debris. Exosomes were then isolated using either differential centrifugation by previously described methods [26] or Exoquick Exosome Precipitation Solution [27] (System Biosciences), which both yielded high quantities of purified exosomes. Exosome pellets were then resuspended in the appropriate media and used for assays. Protein content of exosomes were quantified using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific).Transmission Electron MicroscopyExosome pellets were isolated and samples prepared by negative staining method using uranyl acetate. A 20ul aliquot was fixed with 4% PFA for 30 minutes; 6ul was then absorbed onto 200 mesh Formar-carbon coated EM grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 2 minutes and the excess blotted on filter paper. Grids were allowed to dry for 20 minutes then washed twice with MilliQ water and negatively stained with 2.5% uranyl acetate. Data were collected on a JEOL 100CX transmission electron microscope operating at 150kV.Particle AnalysisExosome pellets were suspended in 1mL of MilliQ water, gently vortexed at 2.5k for 10 sec and then bath sonicated for 10 min at 33°C to ensure adequate exosome dispersion in the solution. Particle analysis data was obtained using an LM10 NanoSight instrument.Immunoblot analysisImmunoblot analyses were done with the appropriate antibodies (Table 1) according to standard protocols.

Antibodies used for immunoblot analysis.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165926.t001Cellular Uptake of ExosomesExosomes were isolated from conditioned media of cells at P4 as described above and resuspended in 500ul of 1x PBS. 50ul of 10x Exo-Red (Acridine Orange chemistry) or Exo-Green (Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl diacetate ester (CFSE) chemistry) (System Biosciences) was added to 500ul of resuspended exosomes suspension, inverted to mix, and incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes. To stop the reaction, 100ul of ExoQuick-TC was added (System Biosciences) and the suspension was mixed by inverting 6 times. The labeled exosome sample was placed on ice for 30 minutes then centrifuged for 3 minutes at 14,000rpm. The supernatant was removed and the labeled exosome pellet was resuspended in 500ul of 1x PBS. Target cells were incubated with labeled exosomes and their uptake assessed by flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur) and confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta NLO Confocal Microscope) at various time points.Endothelial Migration AssayHUVECs grown on collagen coated TC plates were cocultured with either media control alone, Scr CDCs, or nSMase2 KD CDCs grown on 0.4 μm pore polyester transwell membrane inserts (Corning) for 24 hours. They were subsequently trypsinized and seeded at a density of 4 x 104 cells per insert in 24 well 8.0 μm pore inserts (Corning) coated with collagen. Cells were maintained in EBM2 supplemented with an additional 10% of exosome free serum for 4 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 prior to fixation in 4% PFA, counterstaining with DAPI, and quantification of total cells and migrated cells (after removal of non-migrated cells from the upper surface of the transwell membrane by “scrubbing”, performed by inserting a cotton tipped swab into the inserts and applying gentle but firm pressure while moving the tip over the membrane surface). Five fields per well were imaged with a Cellomics High Content Screening device at 20x magnification. Experiments were performed in triplicate using CDCs at P4. Significant differences in percentage of migrating cells with each coculture condition was determined using a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s post-hoc test, p<0.05.Matrigel Tube Formation AssayHUVECs cocultured with either media control alone, Scr CDCs or nSMase2 KD CDCs on transwell inserts (0.4μm Pore Polyester Membrane Insert, Corning) for 24 hours were trypsinized and seeded at a density of 5 × 103 cells per well in a 96 well tissue culture plate coated with 50ul of growth factor depleted Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Cells were maintained in EBM2 supplemented with an additional 10% of exosome free FBS and 50ng/ml VEGF at 37°C and 5% CO2. After incubating for 4h, tube formation by endothelial cells was photographed (Nikon inverted microscope, 4x objective) and quantified by measuring the length of tubes with NIH Image and counting the branch points in 10 random fields. Experiments were performed in triplicate using CDCs at P4. Significant differences in vessel length and number of branch points with each treatment was determined using a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s post-hoc test, p<0.05.BrdU Proliferation AssayHUVECs, cardiac fibroblasts and mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes were cocultured with either media control alone, Scr CDCs (P4), or nSMase2 CDCs (P4) on 0.4μm inserts (Corning) for 24 hours in their respective basal media (supplemented with exosome free serum as needed). Cells were pulsed with BrdU (Sigma) for various cell type specific time points (4 hours for HUVECs and cardiac fibroblasts, 5 days for mCM) prior to a 15 minute fixation in 4% PFA, 1 hour incubation with anti-BrdU primary Ab at 1:1000 (rat, Serotec), 1 hour incubation in Alexa Fluor conjugated 488 or 555 goat anti-rat secondary antibody at 1:500 (Molecular Probes), and counterstaining with DAPI.Quantification of cardiomyocyte apoptosis by TUNELFreshly dissociated mCM were coculutred with either media control alone, Scr CDCs (P4) or nSMase2 KD CDCs (P4) for 24 hours prior to fixation and detection of myocyte apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL, Chemicon Inc) and epifluorescence with an FITC filter as described previously[28]. Cultures were costained with TnI and DAPI for quantification.TGF-β StimulationHuman cardiac fibroblasts were treated with reduced serum media to induce cell cycle arrest for 12 hours and subsequently cocultured with either Scr CDCs (P4) or nSMase2KD CDCs (P4) for 24 hours before the addition of TGF-β (10 ng/ml final concentration) for 12 hours. Cell mRNA was isolated with Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was generated (M-MLV RT, Promega) and matching quantities of mRNA were reverse transcribed (SYBR Green, Invitrogen) to evaluate CT levels. Relative expression was calculated using the comparative CT method, with GAPDH as the housekeeping gene. The mean minimal cycle threshold values were calculated from triplicate reactions. The following primers were used: COLI (collagen I) F: 5-CCTCAAGGCTCCAACGAG-3’, R: 5’-CAATCACTGTCTTGCCCCA-3’; COLIII (collagen III), F: 5’-TGGTGTTGGAGCCGCTGCCA-3’,R: 5’-CTCAGCACTAGAATCTGTCC -3’.ResultsHuman CDCs secrete exosomes which are internalized by endothelial cells, cardiac fibroblasts and myocytesRight atrial appendage endomyocardial biopsies (n  =  4 patient biopsies; 20–60 mg) were taken from adult patients undergoing on pump coronary artery bypass surgery. CDC cell surface markers were characterized using flow cytometry. Similar to our previously characterized porcine CDCs, human CDCs expressed high levels of mesenchymal markers CD90 and CD105, but were largely CD45 negative. Like previous studies in porcine CDCs [2], the human CDCs also expressed GATA4 and Nkx2.5, markers of early cardiac development, and were negative for cardiac troponin T (Fig 1).

Particle size analysis and transmission electron microscopy of human CDC exosomes showed a typical size distribution (Fig 2A and 2D). In addition, exosomes expressed exosomal marker proteins CD63 and HSP90 and lacked expression of cytochrome c and EEA1 (markers of mitochondria and late endosomes respectively) which were expressed by their parent cells (Fig 2B and 2C).

Consistent with results in other cell lines, knockdown of nSMase2 markedly reduced exosome release relative to scrambled infected control CDCs. Following two days of confluent culture in a T75, P4 CDC exosomal protein content was 735 ± 30 μg in Scr CDCs vs. 68 ± 38 μg in nSMase2 CDCs (mean ± SEM; n = 3; p = 0.0053 using two-tailed Student’s t test) (Fig 4). There was no significant difference in the number of CDCs between groups at the time of supernatant collection.

The rate of proliferation in lentiviral infected CDCs was similar to control cells, as assessed by 6 hour BrdU pulse (n = 4 samples, P<0.05) (Fig 5A and 5B). Finally, expression of CD90, CD105, and CD45 as quantified by flow cytometry, was similar in control and lentiviral infected CDCs (Fig 5C).

TGF-β stimulation significantly increased collagen I (COLI) and collagen III (COLIII) mRNA expression by 1.6 ± 0.2 and 2 ± 0.1 fold respectively, as determined by quantitative RT-qPCR (mean ± SEM; n = 3; p<0.05 using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test), normalized to GAPDH, without demonstrating any significant difference in COLI or COLIII expression between cardiac fibroblasts cocultured with Scr CDCs and nSMase2 KD CDCs (Fig 8A and 8B). These observations indicate that CDC exosome secretion and subsequent exosome uptake by cardiac fibroblasts had no effect on collagen gene expression. In contrast, when we looked at cardiac fibroblast proliferation under the same coculture conditions, we saw a significant reduction in proliferation quantified by BrdU uptake following a 5 hour pulse in cells cocultured with Scr CDCs (4% ± 3%) vs. cells cocultured with nSMase2 KD CDCs (30% ± 6%), or media control (32% ± 1%) (Fig 8C–8E) (mean ± SEM; n = 3, p<0.05 using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test).

Data are presented as mean ± SEM.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165926.g009DiscussionIn this study, we have presented further evidence that CDC-derived exosomes contribute to the modification of the target cardiac tissue milieu and uniquely demonstrated that these effects are mediated by physiological rather than purified and concentrated quantities of exosomes. This is an important observation as it supports the relevance of spontaneous exosome release as a mechanism of CDC mediated cardiac repair in vivo.Pharmacological modulation of endogenous exosome release from CDCs has previously been examined by pre-conditioning cells with GW5869, a frequently used nSMase inhibitor [15]. However, this pharmacological inhibitor is reversible, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from its use in understanding the role of longer term exosome release in chronic in vivo models of cardiac dysfunction. Pharmacological inhibition also lacks specificity, having activity against nSMase1, 2, and 3 [29–31]. In our work, we employed a genetic approach to block CDC exosomal release on a long-term basis using shRNAi to specifically knockdown nSMase2 expression in transduced human CDCs. We demonstrated that similar to macrophages, exosome release from CDCs is dependent on nSMase2. Furthermore, with creation of stable lentiviral cell lines, constitutive inhibition of exosomal release allowed us to examine the role of exosomes in direct co-culture experiments with CDCs and specific target cells. This provides a novel approach to evaluate the role of physiological exosome release on a long-term basis in chronic animal models of cardiovascular disease.We assessed the contribution of CDC-derived exosomes on specific cell types found within the myocardial cellular milieu that would be exposed to CDC released exosomes in vivo. Interestingly, we found that endothelial cell proliferation or endothelial cell death was not affected by coculture of endothelial cells with either Scr CDCs or nSMase2 KD CDCs. Nevertheless, endothelial cells cocultured with control Scr CDCs showed increased migration and tube formation in an in vitro angiogenesis assay which was blocked by inhibiting exosome release with knockdown of nSMase2. This stimulation of angiogenic activity is consistent with our previous in vivo results showing increased capillary density throughout the heart following intracoronary injection of CDCs in swine with hibernating myocardium[1, 2]. It is also consistent with the increase in capillary density found after focal injection of purified CDC derived exosomes into the border zone of a murine infarction by others [15].Following acute myocardial infarction, fibroblast proliferation leads to the formation of noncontractile scar tissue [32]. This, in combination with the loss of cardiomyocytes, contributes to long-term systolic myocardial dysfunction [9]. In the infarcted heart, fibroblasts are stimulated by cytokines such as TGF-β which then release pro-fibrotic growth factors which stimulate extracellular matrix production and lead to enhanced fibrosis. Interestingly, we found no significant effect of inhibiting exosome release on basal or TGF- β induced COLI and COLIII expression in cardiac fibroblasts cocultured with CDCs. In contrast, exosomes released from CDCs inhibited fibroblast proliferation and this antiproliferative effect was reversed by inhibiting exosome release with nSMase2 knockdown. These data suggest that while hCDC derived exosomes do not affect fibrotic gene expression, they inhibit fibroblast proliferation which likely contributes to the ability of CDCs to reduce myocardial infarct scar volume in vivo as well as reduce interstitial fibrosis in swine with hibernating myocardium [2]. While fibrotic gene expression has not been previously examined in fibroblasts cocultured with CDCs or purified exosomes, it has been evaluated after treatment with purified exosomes from hypoxic rat ckit+ cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). In contrast to human CDCs-derived exosomes, exposure to rat CPC-derived exosomes has been shown to downregulate COLIII expression in fibroblasts [33]. This observation highlights potential differences in the exosomal cargo of CDCs and CPCs, the two most widely studied cardiac stem cell populations.We also assessed the effect of physiological CDC-derived exosome release on in vitro cardiomyocyte cell death and proliferation. Our data demonstrated significant reductions in apoptosis when cardiomyocytes were cocultured with Scr vs. nSMase2 CDCs. In contrast, there were only insignificant trends toward increased CM proliferation over the relatively brief time frame of our in vitro experiments. Furthermore, over a one week time frame, the impact of inhibiting myocyte cell death was 100 fold greater than the denovo generation of myocytes assess using BrdU. These observations suggest that exosomes released from CDCs primarily promote promotes survival of endogenous CMs by inhibiting apoptosis as opposed to stimulating de novo myocyte formation is a subset of surviving CMs. The finding of decreased CM cell death following CDC-derived exosome uptake correlates with the reductions in myocyte apoptosis reported when administering purified CDC derived exosomes immediately after acute myocardial infarction [15]. These findings contrast with the magnitude of in vitro cardiomyoyte apoptosis vs. proliferation found by others, where increased CM proliferation and decreased CM apoptosis are approximately balanced. This could be due in part to differences in the cell culture assays as well as species differences between rat and mouse cardiomyocytes [15]. It may also reflect differing time courses over which these end-points are evaluated. For example, when myocyte apoptosis is assessed acutely after infarction in vivo, apoptosis rates are high and preserving myocytes by short-term inhibition of apoptosis predominates. In contrast, when evaluated over a period of weeks or months after infarction, apoptosis declines and the cumulative effect of exosome release on a low rate of myocyte proliferation could lead to substantial new myocyte formation. As an example of this, our group has demonstrated substantial cumulative endogenous myocyte proliferation in viable dysfunctional myocardium after global intracoronary infusion of CDCs as well as MSCs.A limitation of our study is that the results are specifically related to studying CDCs and exosome release in coculture in vitro. While our findings are consonant with the effect of CDCs on similar histopathologic end points in swine models of myocardial infarction and hibernating myocardium in vivo, additional long-term studies using CDCs with nSMase knocked down in chronic large animal models will be required to establish the impact of inhibiting CDC exosome release in vivo. In addition, further work is necessary to elucidate the functionally relevant cargo of CDC-derived exosomes and validate targets in vivo.In summary, our findings support a differential role of exosomes released from CDCs on the major cell types found in the heart. Their effect on cardiac myocytes primarily reflects an anti-apoptotic effect which prevents myocyte death. In contrast, there is primarily an antiproliferative effect of CDC derived exosomes on cardiac fibroblasts with exosome release stimulating capillary reorganization. While CDC derived exosomes do not appear to significantly simulate significant cardiomyocyte proliferation over the time course of our in vitro study, a very small pro-proliferative effect could lead to significant new myocyte formation over a longer time frame of weeks or months, as has been demonstrated after intracoronary CDC infusion in vivo [2]. Based on our observations, exosomes released by CDCs may have their greatest impact on preventing myocyte death and fibroblast proliferation in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction and account for the favorable short-term effects of intracoronary CDCs infused at the time of myocardial reperfusion [15]. The development of a siRNA approach to effect the long-term inhibition of nSMase and exosome release from CDCs will now facilitate identifying the relative role of exosomes vs. other paracrine factors and direct effects of CDCs on cardiac repair in chronic disease models and help develop translational approaches that afford the best functional outcome from cardiac repair.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Dr. Zhenghong Yuan for supplying the lentiviral vectors for scrambled and nSMase2 shRNA.

In humans, as early as infancy, children have the ability to localize spatial information based on the relationship between an event and environmental features [2,3]. Studies show that a significant improvement in the ability to process spatial and contextual information occurs in adolescence, the consequence of rapid structural and functional changes in the brain from childhood into adolescence [3]. Sex differences in performing spatial tasks have long been observed in humans, non-human primates and rodents [4–9], but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Several studies have suggested that the brain regions that are associated with spatial cognitive processes could be different, or functioning differentially, in each sex [10–14]. However, the key neural circuits and biochemical signaling pathways responsible for these discrepancies are still largely unidentified.There is considerable evidence suggesting that the hippocampus is involved in episodic and spatial memory [15–19]. Sexual dimorphism in hippocampus-dependent behaviors suggests that there could be differences in the anatomical organization of hippocampal circuitry in males and females. However, a several studies have failed to reveal significant differences in hippocampal volume between men and women after correcting for total intracranial volume [20–23], although some have reported a larger hippocampus in women than in men [24,25]. In addition, when the anterior and posterior hippocampal regions were considered separately, one study reported that women exhibited a larger posterior hippocampus than men after normalizing to brain size [22].On the other hand, in view of the proposed role of synaptic plasticity processes in learning and memory, another possibility is that sex differences in hippocampus-dependent tasks could result from dissimilarities in hippocampal LTP induction or expression between males and females. While this hypothesis has not been extensively explored, studies to date have observed sex differences in the magnitude of LTP at entorhinal inputs to the dentate gyrus, the mossy fiber connection to area CA3, and Schaffer collateral inputs to area CA1 [26–31].The pyramidal neurons in hippocampal CA1 receive two types of input from the entorhinal cortex. Neurons in layer II of the entorhinal cortex project indirectly to CA1 via the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 region through the perforant path, while neurons in entorhinal layer III primarily terminate on the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons in CA1 and the subiculum. This monosynaptic pathway from the entorhinal cortex to CA1 is called the temporoammonic pathway (TA). Studies show that lesioning the TA inputs from the entorhinal cortex to CA1 region did not affect the formation of hippocampal memories, but prevented them from becoming consolidated in cortical networks[32,33]. When inputs from area CA3 were removed to isolate the TA-CA1 circuit, place fields of CA1 neurons were preserved, and rats with an isolated CA1 area performed normally in spatial recognition tasks, but were impaired in spatial navigation[34]. These observations suggest that the direct entorhinal-hippocampal connections play a unique and pivotal role in spatial learning and memory. The potential involvement of the TA pathway in sex differences in spatial navigation has not been previously examined. In the present study, we found that adolescent male rats outperformed female rats in retention probes during Morris water maze (MWM) task, a test of spatial memory. Male rats also showed larger magnitude LTP of the TA pathway, consistent with lower AMPA/NMDA receptor ratios at TA-CA1 synapses in males versus females.MethodsAnimalsThree-week old male and female Sprague-Dawley pups were purchased as litters with dams from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN, USA). The number of litters was decided by the number of animals needed for experiments and litter size; usually 2–4 litters were ordered at one time. Pups were weaned upon arrival and then housed in clear Plexiglas cages (46 x 20 x 23 cm, 3 rats/cage, male and female rats housed separately) with wood chip bedding and maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle. The rats were given food and water ad libitum. Experiments were performed between P42 and P77. All experimental procedures involving animals in this study were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Southern Illinois University, which operates according to policies consistent with NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. With the exception of the results shown in the effect of estrogen on the magnitude of theta burst LTP, male and female littermates were compared in all experiments.Morris water maze testThe water maze consisted of a circular pool (1.6 m diameter; 0.6 m height) filled with tepid water (22 ± 1°C) made opaque by the addition of light gray non-toxic paint. A circular Plexiglas escape platform (14.5 cm in diameter) was located in the center of one of the quadrants (northwest quadrant in this study) of the pool. A blue curtain was located on one side of the pool to separate it from a computer-based video tracking system used for data acquisition (AnyMaze, San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). Large black shapes were painted on other walls of the water maze room to serve as additional visual cues. The animals were given 15 trials (acquisition trials) over 5 consecutive days with the platform submerged 2 cm below the surface of the water (three trials per day; 120 s maximum trial duration; 20–30 min inter-trial interval). For each trial, rats were placed at one of three starting locations in pseudorandom order (northeast, southwest, southeast), and were allowed to swim until they located the platform. Rats failing to find the platform within 120 s were hand guided to it. After reaching the platform the animal remained on it for 20 s, after which it was removed from the pool, dried with a towel and placed back into its home cage. Latency and swim distance to find the platform were recorded for learning trials. To assess the memory, probe sessions were performed immediately, 24 h, 7 d and 28 d after the last acquisition trial. For probe trials the platform was removed and rats were placed in the water at the starting location opposite the goal quadrant and allowed to swim for 60 s. The time spent swimming in the goal quadrant, latency to the first cross over the location where the platform had been, and the mean distance (sampled 10 times/s) from the platform location were recorded.Acute slice electrophysiologyThese methods have been described in detail in our previous publications [35,36]. Rats were killed by decapitation after sedation with Euthasol solution (0.5 ml/kg, intraperitoneally;this solution contains 390 mg/ml sodium pentobarbital and 50mg/ml phenytoin sodium; Henry Schein, Melville, NY). Hippocampi were isolated and sectioned into 400-μm-thick slices in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (in mM: 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 1.5 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3, and 10 glucose, bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2) using a Leica VT 1200S vibratome (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL, USA). The slices were maintained at room temperature for over 1 h in an interface holding chamber in a humidified atmosphere saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2. The slices were then transferred to a submersion-type recording chamber and perfused at room temperature with ACSF (flow rate 1–2 ml/min). Concentric bipolar tungsten electrodes were placed either in SLM to stimulate TA afferents or in SR to stimulate SC afferents. Extracellular recording pipettes were filled with ACSF (tip resistances 2–5 MΩ) and placed in the same layer (e.g., in SLM to record TA-CA1 responses), 100–150 μm from the stimulating electrodes. Stimuli (100 μs duration) were delivered at 0.05 Hz. The stimulus intensity was set at 150% of the threshold intensity, resulting in a fEPSP of 0.1–0.4 mV. All compounds were applied by perfusion. fEPSPs were recorded using an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA); responses were low-pass filtered at 10 kHz and amplified 100× prior to digitization. Three LTP induction protocols were employed: a single train of 100 pulses at 100 Hz was used to generate early LTP (ELTP); 4 x HFS, consisting of 4 trains of 100 pulses given at 100 Hz, with a 5 min inter-train interval, and TBS, consisting of 4 trains of 10 bursts at 5 Hz, with each burst contained 4 stimuli at 100 Hz, with a 10 s inter-train interval, were used to generate late LTP (LLTP). The magnitude of LTP was assessed by measuring average of peak amplitudes of fEPSPs (% of last 10 min of baseline) at 51–60 min after LTP stimulation was given.Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were obtained with patch pipettes filled with (in mM): CsCH3SO3 135, HEPES 10, NaCl 10, MgCl2 1, K4BAPTA 0.1, Mg2+-ATP 2, and phosphocreatine 10, and QX-314 adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH. In whole-cell recording experiments, picrotoxin (100 μM) and CGP52432 (4 μM) were included in the ACSF to block GABAA and GABAB receptors respectively. Area CA3 and the DG were removed from the slice to prevent spontaneous epileptiform discharges. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were illuminated with near-infrared (IR) light and visualized with a 40x water-immersion lens; images were detected with an IR-sensitive CCD camera. Electrode resistances in the bath were 3–6 MΩ, and series resistances of <40 MΩ were accepted. Data were collected using a Multiclamp 700B or an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), low-pass filtered at 2k Hz and digitized at 5k Hz using a Digidata 1440A A/D converter and Clampex 10.3 software (Molecular Devices). For calculation of the AMPA/NMDA ratio, the peak amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated current was measured when the cell membrane potential was held at -70 mV, while NMDA receptor-mediated current was recorded when the cell membrane potential was held at +60 mV and was measured 150 ms after a stimulus.Membrane surface protein biotinylationHippocampal slices, prepared as described above, were maintained at room temperature for at least 1 h. Area CA1 SLM wedges were dissected from backlit hippocampal slices with the aid of a dissecting microscope using the clearly identifiable landmarks of the hippocampal fissure and the proximal border of the TA fibers in the distal CA1 dendritic region. The SLM samples were transferred to ice-cold ACSF (bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2) containing 1 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido) ethyldithio-propionate (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) for 1 h to biotinylate surface proteins. Excess biotin was then removed by washing the slices 3 times with ice-cold ACSF to eliminate free sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. Twelve CA1 SLM samples were pooled and homogenized in 600 μl of modified RIPA buffer (Fisher Scientific) containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS and 2 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), supplemented with a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The tissue was homogenized for 30 s and placed on ice under agitation for 1 h. Homogenates (total fractions) were collected, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4°C, after which the supernatants were collected. The total protein concentration in the supernatants was analyzed by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA assay) and modified RIPA buffer was added as necessary to insure that the protein concentrations were equivalent (3 μg/μl) in all samples. A small fraction (20 μg) of the supernatants was removed for total protein measurement by Western blotting. For surface protein detection, 1.25 mg protein samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with prewashed Neutravidin Agarose beads (50 μl, Fisher Scientific) to capture biotinylated proteins. Beads were recovered by a brief centrifugation and the supernatants were discarded. The sedimented beads were washed 3 times in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and biotinylated proteins were finally eluted with loading buffer (boiled at 100°C for 5 min). Biotinylated fractions were collected and levels of surface proteins were estimated by Western blotting. Levels of surface and total GluA1 and GluN1 were expressed as a ratio to actin, which was only detected in total proteins.Western blot analysisSupernatants containing the total proteins (added with loading buffer, boiled at 100°C for 5 min) or biotinylated proteins were loaded into 7.5% Bis-Tris gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). After running in 1× NuPAGE MOPS SDS buffer (Fisher Scientific), a gel was transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 1× NuPAGE transfer buffer (in 20% methanol, wt/vol). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (wt/vol) in buffer containing 1 M Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween-20 (vol/vol) and probed with antibodies to GluA1 (1: 1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA, #13185), and GluN1 (1: 1000, Cell Signaling Technology, #5704) at 4°C overnight. After rinses in TBS-Tween, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at 20–22°C in horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat antibody to rabbit IgG (1: 3000, Fisher Scientific, #31462). The immunoblot was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Fisher Scientific). Levels of expression were computed using ImageJ (NIH). For illustration purposes, blots were cropped and the brightness and contrast were adjusted globally using Photoshop (www.adobe.com).Determining the estrous cycle phaseAs described by others [37,38], the cycle phase of female rats was obtained through vaginal smears. Vaginal secretions were extracted by mild penetration of the vaginal orifice with a water dropper filled with water and examined under a light microscope. The estrous cycle was determined by the proportion of leukocytes, nucleated epithelial cells and cornified cells. Smears containing predominantly leukocytes (≥ 60%) were classified as diestrus. Smears containing predominantly nucleates epithelial cells (≥60%) and few or no leukocytes (≤ 10%) were classified as proestrus. Smears containing primarily cornified cells (≥ 90%) were classified as estrus.Statistical analysisData were analyzed using ANOVA, with repeated measures (RMANOVA) where indicated, followed by Bonferroni post hoc analysis, or 2-tailed t-tests as appropriate (GraphPad Prism 5, La Jolla, CA, USA). All data are presented as mean ± s.e.m.. P values of ≤ 0.05 were considered significant.ResultsTo evaluate for possible sex differences in spatial learning and memory, adolescent male and female rats were tested in the hidden platform version of the MWM. Both male and female rats quickly improved during 5-consecutive-day training session, as measured by reduced escape latencies [F(4,50) = 26; p < 0.0001; RMANOVA]; there was no difference between the sexes [F(1,50) < 0.01; p > 0.05] (Fig 1A and 1B). To test whether the animals had indeed learned the spatial location of the hidden platform, we removed the platform and ran a probe trial immediately after the final training session. We found that both males and females spent aconsiderable amount of time in the goal quadrant searching for the platform (Fig 1C), had short latencies to cross over the platform’s previous location (Fig 1D), and had small mean swim distances from the platform’s position (Fig 1E), indicating that both groups had learned the platform’s location. To determine whether there was a sex difference in short-term memory or memory consolidation of the learned location of the platform, additional probe tests were performed 24 h, 7 d and 28 d after the final training trial. Compared to the immediate probe, time spent swimming in the goal quadrant decreased, while latency to first cross and mean swim distances from the location of the platform increased, while, in both male and female animals during the delayed probe trials. For time in goal quadrant, RMANOVA revealed significant effects for sex [F(1,40) = 20; p < 0.0001] and time [F(3,40) = 20; p < 0.001], but no interaction [F(3,40) = 1.1; p > 0.05]. Post hoc testing showed that males outperformed females on the immediate probe trial as well as on the probes conducted on days 7 and 28 (p < 0.05 for each). For latency to first cross, RMANOVA revealed a marginal effect for sex [F(1,40) = 3.6; p = 0.06], a significant effect for time [F(3,40) = 4.7; p = 0.006], and a significant interaction [F(3,40) = 5.4; p < 0.005]. Post hoc testing showed that males outperformed females on the probes conducted on days 7 and 28 (p < 0.05 for each). For mean distance from the platform, RMANOVA revealed significant effects for sex [F(1,40) = 22; p < 0.0001] and time [F(3,40) = 22; p < 0.001], but no interaction [F(3,40) = 1.1; p > 0.05]. Post hoc testing showed that males outperformed females on the probes conducted on days 7 (p < 0.01) and 28 (p < 0.05).

(B) Mean latencies to find the hidden platform over the 5-day training period. There was no significant difference in the learning curves for male and female animals. (C) Swim times in the goal quadrant during probe trials show that both male and female rats focused their search in the region of the platform’s location during the probe trial given immediately after training. However, males spent more time in the goal quadrant in probe trials given 7d and 28d after training. (D) Time to first cross the platform location during successive probe trials. Times were equivalent for the immediate and 24 h probes, but male rats outperformed females (shorter time to swim to the platform location) 7 d and 28 d after training.

In the 7 d and 28 d probe tests, both male and female animals still actively searched for the platform. However, compared to female rats, the male rats spent more time in the goal quadrant, displayed a shorter latency to first cross the platform location and had smaller mean swim distances from the platform location (Fig 1C–1E), suggesting better memory consolidation of spatial learning.LTP has been suggested to be a molecular mechanism of learning and memory [39–41]. We therefore compared LTP expression at TA-CA1 synapses in acutely prepared hippocampal slices from male and female animals. Field TA-CA1 EPSPs (fEPSPs) were recorded at hippocampal CA1 SLM synapses by stimulating the TA pathway at 0.05 Hz. Specificity of TA-CA1 responses was verified by demonstrating their near-complete blockade when the selective group II mGluR agonist 2-(2,3-dicarboxycyclopropyl) glycine (DCG-IV; 100 μM) was added to the perfused ACSF (Fig 2A) [42]. After a stable baseline was obtained, TA-CA1 LTP was evaluated.

ELTP at TA-CA1 synapses is not different between male and female rats.(A) TA-CA1 fEPSPs were inhibited by DCG-IV (to 19.6 ± 3.5% of baseline, measured 15–20 min after drug application, n = 4 slices from 2 rats. t = 59; p < 0.001).

HFS (4 trains of 100 pulses given at 100 Hz, with a 5 min inter-train interval) also elicited LTP in both male and female rats at TA-CA1 synapses. However, the magnitude of TA-CA1 LTP was significantly greater in slices from male animals compared to female animals (Fig 3A). This result was confirmed using more physiologically patterned stimulation (TBS, see Methods) (Fig 3B). To determine whether this difference was common to other inputs to CA1, we recorded HFS- and TBS-LTP induced by stimulating the Schaffer collateral pathway (SC) in stratum radiatum. We found that there was no difference between males and females in the magnitude of HFS-LTP or TBS-LTP at SC-CA1 synapses (Fig 3C and 3D).

Male rats exhibit larger LLTP at TA-CA1 synapses.(A) Compared with female rats, male rats expressed greater TA-CA1 pathway LTP after high frequency stimulation (HFS, 4 trains of 100 pulses given at 100 Hz, with a 5 min inter-train interval) (130.2 ± 2.1% in males, n = 14 slices from 8 animals; 113.0 ± 3.1% in females, n = 12 slices, 8 animals. t = 4.71, p < 0.0001). (B) Male rats also expressed more TA-CA1 LTP following theta burst stimulation (TBS, 4 trains of 10 bursts at 5 Hz, with each burst consisting of 4 stimuli given at 100 Hz, 10 s inter-train interval) (122.3 ± 3.4% in males, n = 8 slices from 6 animals; 110.0 ± 0.9% in females, n = 9 slices from 7 animals. t = 3.69, p < 0.01). (C) SC-CA1 HFS-induced LTP was not significantly different between male and female rats (194.0 ± 20.2% in males, n = 7 slices from 4 animals; 193.5 ± 24.9% in females, n = 8 slices from 5 animals. t = 0.02, p > 0.05). (D) TBS-induced LTP at SC-CA1 synapses was also not different between male and female rats (143.9 ± 7.4% in males, n = 9 slices from 5 animals; 136.5 ± 8.0% in females, n = 6 slices from 5 animals. t = 0.66, p > 0.05). Representative fEPSPs traces before and after HFS or TBS are shown in each panel; scale bars: 0.2 mv, 10 ms. Dashed lines indicate the baseline response level, which was normalized to 100%. LTP magnitude was quantified as the normalized mean amplitude of fEPSPs measured at 51–60 min.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165891.g003Gonadal hormones have been reported to modulate neural morphology and synaptic plasticity [43,44]. We wondered whether the differential levels of endogenous estrogen in male and female animals were involved in the difference in TA-CA1 LTP expression. We therefore compared TA-CA1 LTP evoked by TBS stimulation in slices from females in the proestrus phase (high estrogen) to the slices from the females in the diestrus phase (low estrogen) of the menstrual cycle. We found that the magnitude of TA-CA1 LTP was not significantly different between the two stages (Fig 4A). Furthermore, 17β-estradiol (1 nM) applied for 90 minutes prior to TBS did not alter the magnitude of TA-CA1 LTP recorded in slices from male rats (Fig 4B). Estradiol (1 nM) increased both TA-CA1 fEPSPs and SC-CA1 fEPSPs recorded in slices from male rats, but the effect was larger in the SC-CA1 pathway (Fig 4C).

The magnitude of theta burst LTP is not altered by estrogen.(A) There was no difference in TBS-induced TA-CA1 LTP was recorded in slices made from female animals in proestrus versus diestrus (proestrus: 115.6 ± 2.8%, n = 17 slices from 6 animals; diestrus, 114.4 ± 2.8%, n = 16 slices from 9 animals. t = 0.3, p > 0.05). (B) The magnitude of theta burst LTP at TA-CA1 synapses was not affected by estradiol treatment of slices from male rats (estrogen pretreated slices: 122.3 ± 5.4%, n = 31 slices from 24 rats; control slices: 120.9 ± 4.6%, n = 15 slices from 12 rats. t = 0.17, p > 0.05). (C) Time course (left) and data summary (right) illustrate that estradiol (1 nM) application to hippocampal slices from male rats resulted in a large increase in SC-CA1 fEPSPs (131.6 ± 4.7%, n = 10 slices from 6 animals) but less of an increase of TA-CA1 fEPSPs (111.4 ± 2.3%, n = 13 slices from 10 animals).

For this comparison, we first examined the efficiency of excitatory synaptic transmission at TA-CA1 synapses by plotting the TA-CA1 fEPSP peak amplitude as a function of the fiber volley. We found that, particularly at higher stimulus intensities, fEPSP amplitudes for a similar fiber volley were larger in males compared to females (Fig 5A). RMANOVA revealed significant overall effects for sex [F(1,168) = 18; p < 0.0001] and fiber volley amplitude [F(5,168) = 37; p < 0.0001], but no interaction [F(5,168) = 1.4; p > 0.05]. Bonferroni post-hoc tests indicated that EPSP amplitudes were significantly larger for males at the two highest fiber volley amplitudes. Presynaptic characteristics of TA–CA1 synapses were assessed by measuring the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), which is the ratio of the peak amplitude of fEPSPs to two consecutive TA stimuli delivered at different time intervals. We observed that PPF was not significantly different at TA-CA1 synapses between male and female animals (Fig 5B), indicating that the probability of presynaptic release at these synapses was not affected by sex. We then tested whether spontaneous synaptic transmission in CA1 is different between male and female rats. Spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) were recorded from the soma of CA1 pyramidal cells in whole-cell voltage clamp mode in the presence of picrotoxin (100 μM) and CGP52432 (4 μM) to block GABAA and GABAB receptors, respectively. Area CA3 and the dentate gyrus were cut from the slice to prevent spontaneous epileptiform discharges. We found that neither amplitude nor frequency of hippocampal CA1 sEPSCs was significantly different between male and female rats (Fig 5C–5E).

Comparison of basal synaptic transmission at TA-CA1 synapses in male and female rats.(A) A plot of TA-CA1 fEPSP slopes as a function of fiber volley amplitude revealed that slices from male animals exhibited a greater postsynaptic response at higher stimulus intensities than slices from female animals in response to similar presynaptic depolarization (male, n = 14 slices from 5 animals; female, n = 16 slices from 5 animals. *p<0.05). (B) Paired stimulation of TA-CA1 afferents at intervals of 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 ms was given and paired pulse ratios (PPR) were calculated by dividing the peak amplitude of the second fEPSP by the peak amplitude of the first fEPSP. No differences in PPRs between males and females were seen (male, n = 15 slices from 5 animals; female, n = 11 slices from 5 animals). (C-E) Representative traces and data summaries show that neither the peak amplitude nor the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs recorded at the soma of CA1 pyramidal cells was different between males and females (mean amplitudes: male, 9.2 ± 1.6 pA, n = 6 cells from 1 animal; female, 7.2 ± 0.9 pA, n = 6 cells from 2 animals, t = 1.1, p > 0.05; mean inter-event intervals: male, 2.4 ± 0.6 s, n = 6 cells from 1 animal; female, 2.1 ± 0.2 s, n = 6 cells from 2 animals, t = 0.46, p > 0.05).              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165891.g005The number of postsynaptic NMDA receptors, or the ratio of functional AMPA to NMDA receptors, may influence the induction or expression of LTP. We therefore determined the ratio of AMPA receptor-mediated and NMDA receptor-mediated evoked EPSCs (AMPA/NMDA ratio) at TA-CA1 and SC-CA1 synapses in both male and female rats. We found that AMPA/NMDA ratio was smaller at TA-CA1 synapses than that at SC-CA1 synapses in male rats (Fig 6A and 6B), consistent with a previous report [45]. In contrast, the ratio was greater at TA-CA1 synapses than that at SC-CA1 synapses in female rats. Remarkably, female rats exhibited a much larger (213%) AMPA/NMDA ratio at TA-CA1 synapses compared to their male littermates, but there was no significant difference in the ratio at SC-CA1 synapses between males and females (Fig 6A and 6B). We next isolated the NMDA receptor-mediated component of TA-CA1 fEPSPs recorded extracellularly at CA1 SLM by blocking non-NMDA glutamate receptors with DNQX (50 μM) in magnesium-free saline and in the presence of picrotoxin (100 μM) and CGP52432 (4 μM). Consistent with the observations from whole-cell recordings, the AMPA /NMDA ratio at TA-CA1 fEPSPs was significantly smaller in male animals (Fig 6C and 6D).

The AMPA/NMDA ratio was significantly larger in females. ** t = 3.62, p < 0.01.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165891.g006A smaller AMPA/NMDA ratio could result from a smaller AMPA component or a larger NMDA component. To examine these possibilities, we assessed postsynaptic membrane surface, as well as total, expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors at TA-CA1 synapses in the hippocampal CA1 SLM region of male and female animals. The major forms of AMPA receptors in the hippocampus include GluA1 homomers as well as GluA1/2 and GluA2/3 heteromers [46,47]. The functional role of GluA1 and the phosphorylation of the subunit have been extensively investigated in AMPA receptor trafficking and LTP expression. We therefore examined surface GluA1 expression using synaptosomes isolated from CA1 SLM wedges. Surprisingly, we found that male rats expressed slightly, but significantly (12%), more surface GluA1 in the SLM region of CA1 than female animals (Fig 7A). Total GluA1 expression was not different in CA1 SLM between males and females. NMDARs are tetramers and are assembled from GluN1 and GluN2subunits. We compared the membrane surface and total GluN1 subunit expression in the CA1 SLM region between male and female animals. We found that male rats expressed markedly more surface (21%) and total GluN1 (18%) than female rats (Fig 7B). Taken together, the observation of more surface NMDA receptors and a relatively smaller surface receptor AMPA/NMDA ratio in male CA1 SLM provides a plausible explanation for our observation of greater TA-CA1 LTP recorded in the male rats.

Data from human studies reveal a consistent male advantage in a variety of spatial tasks [48,49]. However, the reports of sex effects on spatial ability in rodents are divergent and controversial. Sprague-Dawley rats, for example, show a substantially larger male advantage than any other strain [49]. In general, male rats outperform females in the radial arm maze and water maze tests, but in mice the male advantage in the radial arm maze is much less and females tend to outperform males in the water maze [50]. Our observations in the present study, using adolescent animals, are consistent with the majority of other studies showing that adult male Sprague-Dawley rats outperform adult females in the standard water maze test.We observed that sex differences in hippocampal LTP depended upon both the pathway and the stimulation paradigm employed. We found that ELTP stimulation of the TA-CA1 pathway generated comparable LTP in males and females. In contrast, when LLTP stimulation paradigms were used, male rats exhibited larger magnitude HFS- and theta burst-induced TA-CA1 LTP than female rats. In our study, male and female rats expressed similar LTP at SC-CA1 synapses, suggesting that sex differences in LTP are synapse, as well as stimulation paradigm, specific. Overall, the differences we observed, while statistically significant, were not large. Recordings from littermates (Fig 3) provided the most convincing evidence for a sex difference in TA-CA1 LTP. In recordings made from nonlittermates (Fig 4) the sex difference was reduced, although TBS-LTP in the TA-CA1 pathway of females was still significantly smaller than for males when all the data were considered together. Other studies evaluating the effect of sex on SC-CA1 LTP have shown either no difference [31] or greater LTP in males[30,31], depending upon the stimulation paradigm that was employed. An additional complication in comparing studies is that, at least in vivo, it has been shown that the magnitude of SC-CA1 LTP varies across the estrous cycle [51]. Estrous status was not documented in either of the above-cited studies.It has been postulated that gonadal hormone fluctuations across the female estrus cycle could account for inconsistent performance in spatial navigation tasks [52–54]. Substantial literature suggests that ovarian steroids, such as 17-β estradiol, modulate hippocampal dendritic spine density, synaptic activity and synaptic plasticity across the estrus cycle, with the highest level of excitatory effect during proestrus [55,56]. However, the behavioral impact of these changes is controversial. A study in humans showed superior spatial and nonspatial learning during the estrus (low estrogen) rather than proestrus phase (high estrogen) [54]. Another study observed that ovariectomized female rats outperformed intact female rats in radial maze and water maze tasks [57]. Interestingly, ‘sex-reversed’ female mice (which carry a Y chromosome) perform better in the MWM than normal females, suggesting an important role for male genotype (as opposed to hormonal complement) on hippocampus-dependent spatial learning [58]. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that sex differences are present in pre-pubertal children (as early as age 4 and in the same direction as in adults) in virtual reality-based tasks [59,60], indicating that sex differences in spatial learning and memory exist prior to puberty and do not appear to require the effects of sex hormones at puberty.Electrophysiological studies have shown that estradiol can enhance baseline responses and LTP at SC-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus of either male or ovariectomized female rats [43,61]. To test whether endogenous estrogen plays a role on LTP expression at TA-CA1 synapses, we tested the effect of estradiol on SC-CA1 and TA-CA1 fEPSPs and LTP in slices from male rats, as well as comparing TA-CA1 LTP in females in proestrus and diestrus phases. We found that acute estradiol application increased baseline responses in the SC-CA1 connection, and slightly enhanced TA-CA1 responses. However, estradiol did not alter the amplitude of TA-CA1 LTP in males. We also observed that TA-CA1 LTP magnitude was not different between female rats in the two different stages of the menstrual cycle. These results are consistent with a recent study from Smith et al. that estradiol administration to ovariectomized female rats increased both AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated currents, but did not increase LTP magnitude, at TA-CA1 synapses [62]. In sum, our results indicate that reduced LLTP expression at TA-CA1 synapses in female rats is likely not attributable to varying estrogen levels across the estrus cycle.It is widely accepted that the medial temporal lobe is pivotal for encoding, consolidation and short-term storage of explicit memory. A recent elegant study using optogenetic and electrophysiological methods showed that hippocampal place cells receive direct input from grid cells, as well as from border cells and head-direction cells [63]. This observation is consistent with the idea that hippocampal place cells integrate both allocentric and egocentric information in guiding spatial navigation [64]. Grid cells have been found in all of the layers of the medial entorhinal cortex and are intermingled with other spatial cells in deep layers [63]. It is still not completely clear how the outputs of entorhinal grid cells are integrated in hippocampal CA regions to contribute to hippocampal place field and spatial navigation. Interestingly, Brun et al. showed that removing the tri-synaptic input (EC layer II-DG-CA3-CA1) did not affect CA1 place fields, suggesting that spatial information from the entorhinal cortex may bypass DG and CA3, and be conveyed directly to CA1 by the TA pathway originating in layer III of the entorhinal cortex. Further, behavioral studies have shown that the isolated TA-CA1 input is sufficient to support spatial recognition in the water maze, although both the tri-synaptic inputs and the TA-CA1 inputs are necessary for recall of remote locations or the trajectories towards these locations [34]. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that sex differences in TA-CA1 plasticity could affect spatial memory.NMDA receptors play a critical role in both LTP and in spatial learning and memory [65–67]. In CA1 pyramidal cells, NMDARs contain mainly GluN2A and/or GluN2B subunits in addition to GluN1. In NMDA receptor-dependent LTP, an NMDAR-mediated rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ activates a complex cascade of kinases and phosphatases that promotes AMPA receptor insertion in postsynaptic membranes and causes persistent changes in synaptic strength. We found that postsynaptic NMDA receptor expression was higher at TA-CA1 synapses in male rats, although male rats expressed slightly higher GluA1-containing AMPA receptors in SLM as well. Accordingly, the AMPA/NMDA receptor ratio was lower in males. Although the correlation between the AMPA/NMDA ratio and magnitude of LTP has not been systematically studied, the amount and duration of Ca2+ influx from NMDA receptor is critical to induce LTP or LTD [68]. In addition, an increase in AMPA receptor-mediated fast synaptic transmission and increase in the AMPA/NMDA receptor ratio occludes the induction of LTP [69] and impairs associative learning [67]. Thus, in males, greater surface expression of NMDA receptors may result in more Ca2+ entry, facilitating LTP induction. However, the role of AMPA/NMDA receptor ratios in inducing ELTP- versus LLTP-stimulated changes in synaptic strength remains to be further explored.A key question is whether, and how, increased TA-CA1 LLTP magnitude translates into longer memory in the water maze task. Males and females showed similar memory at 24hrs after training, but males outperformed females at longer delays. Whether a sex difference in the biochemical mechanisms elicited by LLTP (but not ELTP) stimulation in the TA-CA1 connection is responsible for this difference is a subject for further research. To begin to answer this question, a future study will focus on making selective TA lesions to validate a role of this pathway in the sex difference we observed in memory consolidation. In addition, it will be important to demonstrate that the sex differences in TA-CA1 plasticity we observed in adolescent animals are also seen in adults.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Dr. Peter Patrylo, Dr. Huaixing Wang and Dr. Zhongmin Yuan for their technical support.Author ContributionsConceptualization: XC.Data curation: XC GR.Formal analysis: GR XC.Funding acquisition: XC ZW MH.Investigation: XQ KZ TX VY ZW MH GR XC.Methodology: XC GR KZ.Project administration: XC.Resources: XC GR.Software: XC GR.Supervision: XC GR.Validation: XC XQ GR.Visualization: XC GR.Writing – original draft: XC.Writing – review & editing: GR XC.References1.

Chronic pesticide exposure has contributed to the decline of water quality in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) region where intensive agricultural practices occur adjacent to sensitive marine habitats [2]. It is estimated that up to 30 tonnes photosystem II (PSII) herbicides are transported into the GBR lagoon annually [3] and concentrations higher than 10 μg l-1 can be detected in the receiving waters [4]. PSII herbicide concentrations in the GBR lagoon are generally lower but have exceeded current water quality guidelines [5, 6] and can affect photosynthesis and growth in sensitive marine organisms, such as seagrass [7, 8]. The five most commonly detected PSII herbicides, diuron, atrazine, hexazinone, tebuthiuron and ametryn, have been designated “priority herbicides” by management agencies and are monitored and managed as part of an overall GBR management and protection plan [9]. Although most extensively studied in the catchments and the lagoon of the GBR, PSII herbicides are present in nearshore marine systems across the world [10–14].PSII herbicides are detected at higher concentrations during flood plumes which enter the GBR lagoon over the summer monsoon period [15, 16], but these contaminants are also found in low concentrations year round [17, 18] suggesting long environmental persistence. Evidence of degradation in the environment is shown by the detection of the breakdown products of atrazine and diuron in the GBR region [15, 16, 19] sometimes reaching concentrations over 2 μg l-1 at highly contaminated sites [20]. The persistence of contaminants in the environment is governed by the rates of multiple processes including hydrolysis, light/ UV driven photolysis and microbial degradation (metabolism) [21–23]. Microbial degradation is considered the dominant route of degradation for most PSII herbicides in aquatic systems [22, 24, 25] and our recent standard flask study indicates very slow degradation of diuron, atrazine, hexazinone and tebuthiuron in seawater, with evidence of both hydrolysis and microbial metabolism of these herbicides [26].There is a relatively large number of in situ and laboratory studies on the persistence of PSII herbicides in freshwater aquatic systems (see [27]); however, few laboratory studies have examined persistence in seawater (summarised in [26]). The long seawater persistence of PSII herbicides observed in standard flask studies (half-lives >500 d) [26] indicates slower degradation than in freshwater, and may be influenced by a range of factors including salinity, pH and alternative organic carbon food sources and concentrations of other nutrients, which in turn affect microbial degradation and hydrolysis. Most previous studies on PSII herbicide persistence in seawater were not conducted for long enough to calculate reliable estimates of half-lives and several of these studies applied very high initial concentrations of herbicides (e.g. 5000 μg l-1) which may affect degradation rates by artificially influencing natural microbial communities and/or may be toxic to some components of the communities [26]. Our previous degradation studies applied the most natural conditions practical in a standard flask environment [26, 28], including low contaminant concentrations (~10 μg l-1), native microbial communities, no artificial nutrients and tests were conducted over 12 months under different light and temperature conditions [26, 29]. The application of low light increased the degradation rates of diuron, tebuthiuron and the non-PSII herbicide glyphosate, and slowed the degradation of the non-PSII herbicide 2,4-D [26, 29]. An increase in temperature from 25°C to 31°C increased degradation of diuron, hexazinone, tebuthiuron, 2,4-D and glyphosate and slowed the degradation of atrazine. While providing some of the first reliable standard flask persistence data in marine systems for several herbicides under highly controlled conditions, these studies highlighted the strong influence on persistence of field-relevant factors, including light and temperature [26, 29].The potential environmental risks posed by pesticides can only be assessed when their fate in the environment, including potential degradation rates under field-relevant conditions are understood [1]. All previous studies testing the persistence of herbicides in seawater have been performed in standard flask tests in the absence of marine sediments and variable sunlight (summarised in [26]). Although useful for less persistent contaminants and for comparison of persistence across standard conditions, the rates of degradation may be unrealistic in short standard flask tests due to the absence of more natural microbial communities and conditions associated with open systems and coastal sediments. In order to determine the persistence of commonly detected herbicides under more natural conditions we conducted a year-long degradation experiment on commonly detected herbicides in a series of replicate open tanks. The experiment was not designed to assess degradation pathways, rather we tested the effects of natural parameters which might affect persistence, including natural light intensities and the presence of coastal sediments in some treatments. Therefore, the present study was designed to deliver more ecologically relevant persistence data for inclusion by regulators and resource managers in future risk assessmentsMaterials and MethodsApproach and experimental designThis study describes a series of outdoor open tank experiments to measure the degradation of herbicides under conditions more natural than those applied in standard flask tests. These tests were conducted in large open tanks with water circulation over the course of a year under both fully dark and light conditions (partially shaded, natural diurnal cycle) and in the presence and absence of natural sediments (Table 1).

Four experimental treatments in the 40-tank open tank experiment.The PSII mix comprised of diuron, atrazine, hexazinone and tebuthiuron and the non-PSII mix of 2,4-D and metolachlor, each added at ~10 μg l-1. Each tank contained 120 l coastal seawater, temperature range (21–37°C).              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165890.t001The open fibreglass tanks (120 l) were situated in an outdoor glasshouse in two stacked rows of 10 (20 in the top rows and 20 in the bottom rows, each tank was 44 x 70 x 40 cm (W x L x D). The top 20 tanks were partially shaded (70%) and exposed to a natural diurnal cycle of moderate intensity up to a daily maximum of 700 μmol photons m-2s-1 (photosynthetically active radiation) as measured using light and temperature loggers placed at the base of tanks (Hobo UA-001-64, Onset, Bourne, MA). No UV penetration into the tanks was observed over the course of the experiment (Solartech UV Radiometer). The bottom row was fully shaded at all times. Evaporation was minimised with loose-fitting clear acrylic lids on the top row and opaque foam on the bottom row and water continuously circulated in each tank using aquarium circulation pumps (Turbelle Nanostream 6045; 4500 l/hour). While there was some visible turbidity generated for the first day of the experiment, this was not apparent during the remainder of the experiments. After every sampling period, evaporation losses were replenished with equal volumes of MilliQ freshwater. Logged temperatures averaged 28°C (range 21–37°C) in the light and 26°C (21–32°C) in the dark, with pH ranging from 8.1–8.4, salinity 32–35 psu and dissolved oxygen remained over 7.5 mg l-1 in all treatments.Sediments and waterCoastal seawater was collected from the shoreline of Australian Institute of Marine Science (19°16’ S, 147° 03’ E), Cape Cleveland, QLD and filtered to 20 μm to remove medium-large plankton. Intertidal sediments, containing no detectable concentrations of herbicides (see Results) were collected from the intertidal zone of low tide from Cockle Bay, Magnetic Island, Queensland (19°10’ S, 146° 49’ E). Both water and sediments were collected under the permit G12/35236.1 issued by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The experimental water was sampled and analysed for nutrients as previously reported [26] (S1 Table). Nutrients in the seawater were typical of coastal GBR waters at the beginning of the experiment [30]. Water samples were also taken from each tank for nutrient analysis at the end of the experiment (365 d) but inadvertent spiking of the water samples with an internal herbicide standard in acetone meant that only a subset of nutrients (NH4, PO4, NO2+NO3, NO2) were available for comparison between treatment types (S1 Table). The mean sediment particle size was 734 μm and contained 3.3%, 0.06% and 0.009% total carbon, total organic carbon and total nitrogen, respectively. The sediments were prepared one week prior to use by sieving (> 2 mm removed), thorough mixing and conditioning in shallow trays placed in two 1000 l tanks with 20 μm filtered and aerated seawater. During this conditioning process, half of the sediment was held in a dark trough (dark treatment) and the other half was held in 70% shaded sunlight (light treatment). This conditioning process allowed for microbial community transition to final experimental conditions prior to the start of the experiment (sediments conditioned in the light were used in the light treatments and sediments conditioned in the dark were used in dark treatments). To allow for periodic sediment sampling without disruption of sediment communities, the sediments were distributed into a single large and 11 small dishes in each tank which could be removed without disturbing the majority of the sediment. The large dishes (25 cm x 22 cm x 5 cm) were filled with 3.0 kg of sediment (wet weight) and the small ceramic dishes (6.5 cm diameter) with 70 g sediment. In total the sediments covered approximately 30% of the floor of each tank. Physical and chemical information on the seawater and sediments from the open tank experiment may be found in the Supplemental Information (S1 Table).Herbicide addition, sampling and analysisHerbicide treatments and replicates (n = 3 or 4, see Table 1) were randomised among tanks. The six herbicides (Table 1) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (>95% purity) and introduced as mixtures (using ethanol as a carrier < 0.03% v/v) to the seawater of each tank as per [26] at moderate concentrations (nominal 10 μg l-1, measured concentrations reported in Results) to maximise environmental relevance [6, 26, 28]. Herbicide concentrations can be detected in the nearshore marine environment at concentrations up to ~2 μg l-1 [31] and over 20 μg l-1 in heavily polluted rivers and estuaries [32]. The concentrations applied allowed direct analysis without pre-concentrations steps to maximise measurement precision. It is possible that isolated herbicides may degrade differently than those in mixtures; however, herbicides are almost always detected in mixtures in the environment [4, 31] and each contributed only ~1% of the overall dissolved organic carbon available for microbial degradation (S1 Table). Therefore, testing herbicide mixtures rather than single herbicides is environmentally relevant and enabled more frequent analyses as herbicides could be quantified simultaneously. Sample collection, internal standard addition and analytical techniques (HPLC-MS/MS using an AB/Sciex API5500Q mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface and coupled to a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system) were as previously reported [26]. Samples were collected on days 0, 21, 60, 100, 120, 180, 210, 240, 300 and 365. These 10 sampling points chosen included 60 d which is the standard duration of an OECD biodegradation test [28] and lasted for a year in recognition of the long persistence of these herbicides in standard flask tests [26]. Samples were run via direct injection, with a standard calibration at beginning and end, and additional quality control standards were run every 10 samples. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the microbial populations in the seawater used in the experiment (S6 Table). Samples were fixed with 5% formaldehyde and stored at 4°C. Sub-samples were stained using Sybr Green, diluted to 1:10,000, and allowed to develop in the dark for 30 min. Samples were run using a BD Accuri C6 cytometer (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) equipped with a red and blue laser (488 nm, 50mW maximum solid state; 640 nm, 30mW diode) and standard filter setup. Flow rate was 14 μl min−1, 10-μm core.Sediments were sampled by removing small dishes using long aluminium tongs. The sediment samples were homogenised and then transferred to centrifuge tubes and weighed. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 x g, excess water removed, and stored at -20°C prior to herbicide extraction [33]. Sediments were exhaustively extracted with acetone and concentrated to near dryness. Agilent QuEChERS kits and protocols were used for extract clean-up as per the manufacturer’s protocols (Agilent application notes 5990-3937EN and 5989-8614EN). Samples for 2,4-D required a pre-extraction hydrolysis step with 5M NaOH for 30 min [34]. The pH of the samples was then neutralised with 5N H2SO4. Cleaned extracts were evaporated to dryness and reconstituted into MilliQ water prior to LC/MS analysis [26]. Percent recovery for herbicide concentrations in the sediment samples were 87.1 to 118.5% (S2 Table).Data analysisHalf-life (t1/2) calculations assumed first order kinetics [26] and were estimated from the decline in experiment concentration of herbicide in seawater using the rate constant (k) slope of the data obtained from plots of the natural logarithm of the concentrations versus time (t), where t1/2 = ln(2)/k [35, 36]. Herbicide concentrations below the reporting limit were removed from the analysis [26]. The concentration data was tested for normality and analysed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Number Cruncher Statistical System (NCSS 9) (Statistical and Power Analysis Software) across the time points sampled. Significance was determined if the resulting p-value was <0.05 between the initial concentration at day 0 and specified time point (e.g. day 60, day 365). The probability that t1/2 was statistically different between light and sediment treatments was tested by applying the F test (Graph Pad Prism V 6.0). Differences in t1/2 were considered significant when p < 0.05.Results1. OverviewAll herbicides degraded according to pseudo-first order kinetics with linear relationships evident for plots of ln (concentration) vs time under all four treatment conditions (Figs 1–6).

Degradation rates in the dark without sedimentsAtrazine and diuron degraded 3- to 6–fold more rapidly than hexazinone and tebuthiuron in the dark without sediments (Table 2). The non-PSII herbicides metolachlor and 2,4-D degraded more rapidly than the PSII herbicides under these conditions with the shortest half-life being 59 days for 2,4-D (Table 2).3. Light and sediment effectsThe effects of light and sediment resulted in significantly different degradation rates (ln [concentration] versus time) for all herbicides under most experimental conditions (S3 Table). The persistence ratios (half-life of herbicide from a given treatment divided by the half–life of the same herbicide under control (dark, without sediments) conditions) demonstrates the scale of effect of the different treatments (Table 3). For example, the t½ for diuron of 404 d in the light, no sediments (Table 2) was shorter than under “standard” (dark, no sediment) conditions and consequently had a persistence ratio of 0.81 (Table 3). Light also significantly reduced the persistence of hexazinone and metolachlor, while atrazine degradation was not affected (Table 3). The presence of light increased the persistence of tebuthiuron almost 2-fold and 2,4-D over 30-fold to 1920 d (Tables 2 and 3). The addition of sediments under dark conditions increased the rates of degradation of diuron, atrazine, hexazinone and metolachlor by between (~30% and 50%) but had no impact on the degradation rates of tebuthiuron or 2,4-D (Table 2). The simultaneous effects of sediments and light resulted in the most rapid degradation of all herbicides except for 2,4-D (Tables 2 and 3). Atrazine exhibited the most rapid degradation of all the PSII herbicides under these conditions with a t½ of 107 d (Table 2), while the t½ of 32 d for metolachlor represented the most rapid degradation in the experiment. 2,4-D degraded almost 4-fold slower under these conditions than in the dark without sediments (Tables 2 and 3).

MetabolitesMetabolites for atrazine were observed for all treatments which contained atrazine at concentrations above the reporting limit of 0.2 μg l-1. On average, desethyl atrazine (DEA) was detected more often and at slightly higher concentrations than desisopropyl atrazine (DIA) in the PSII treatments (See Fig 7). The maximum individual concentrations for the metabolites were 0.38 and 0.76 μg l-1 for DIA atrazine and DEA, respectively (365 day samples, dark with sediment treatment). These metabolites were detectable from the 60 day sampling onwards and were generally detected for the rest of the experiment. As the concentrations were close to the reporting limit no quantitative comparisons have been made. The main stable metabolite for diuron, 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA), was not detected in water samples. Only these three metabolites (DEA, DIA, 3,4-DCA) were analysed as standards were not available for quantification of other transformation products.

Herbicides in sedimentsHerbicides were analysed in sediments at 60 and 365 d and for all herbicides less than 1% of the total herbicides in each tank was associated with the sediments (S4 Table). For all herbicides, concentrations were higher in the 60 day samples (maximum ≤ 4 μg kg-1) than the 365 day samples; the only exception was tebuthiuron in the light which did not change between sampling periods. Metabolites of atrazine were detected at low concentrations (≤ 0.03 μg kg-1) in sediments (S4 Table).DiscussionAn important element in assessing environmental risks posed by pesticides in the environment is to measure their potential degradation rates [1]. Our previous standard flask experiments demonstrated very long persistence of herbicides in coastal seawater [26, 29]. Here, under more environmentally relevant conditions, we confirm the long persistence of PSII herbicides in seawater and demonstrate very strong influences of variable light in combination with the presence of coastal sediments, which can reduce persistence by up to 10-fold. Although the effects of these environmental factors on persistence was consistent for the PSII herbicides and the non-PSII herbicide metolachlor, light (in the absence of UV) had an opposite effect on the degradation of 2,4-D which exhibited a 5-fold longer half-life in the presence of light and sediment in comparison to the standard dark, no sediment conditions. These results help explain the year-round presence of PSII herbicides in tropical estuarine and marine systems and underscore the need for more realistic experimental data on pesticide persistence in sensitive marine habitats.Effects of light on persistenceThe presence of variable light: (i) significantly shortened the persistence of diuron, hexazinone and metolachlor; (ii) had no effect on atrazine; and (iii) increased the half-lives of tebuthiuron and, more dramatically 2,4-D. Photolysis or photodegradation may have contributed in cases of more rapid degradation (by 19–41%); however, other studies have reported only minor contributions of hydrolysis and photodegradation of diuron [37, 38] and hexazinone [24]. Photolysis has been shown to contribute to more rapid degradation of atrazine [39] and 2,4-D in [40] in shallow, full sunlight experiments; however, UV is likely to be highly attenuated in turbid nearshore waters of the GBR [41] and UV light did not penetrate the tanks in our setup, thus UV exposure would not have contributed to the influence of light on persistence. We previously demonstrated that low light (40 μmol photons m-2s-1) can significantly affect degradation of PSII herbicides in seawater, possibly due to changes in microbial community structure affecting the biodegradation [26]. However, the influence of light on the rates of biodegradation is unlikely to be predictable and may increase or decrease biodegradation, depending on intensity, duration and the initial community composition. In the cases of tebuthiuron and 2,4-D which exhibited (1.9-fold– 33-fold) longer persistence, the presence of light may have directly favoured bacteria less able to metabolise the herbicides (a direct effect) or may have changed the nature of other organic carbon in the system to form more metabolically available carbon sources (indirect effect). This could only be addressed by applying labelled substrates and herbicides and carefully assessing the nature and fate of transformation products [1], an exercise that could not be undertaken in our large experimental system and beyond the scope of the current study. The treatments exposed to light were slightly (mean 2°C) warmer than the fully dark treatments but, given our previous flask experiment [26] demonstrated only minor effects on persistence of a larger 6°C increase, temperature was unlikely to have had a major influence on persistence here. The herbicide concentrations applied in the current study were high enough to affect photosynthesis and growth in microalgae [42]; however, a recent study indicated no significant impact of similar concentrations of diuron on the community structure of bacteria, which are likely to have a greater direct impact on herbicide degradation [43]. Algal growth was noted but not quantified in all of the light treatments, indicating the herbicide concentrations were not toxic to all phototrophs.Effects of sediment on persistenceThe presence of coastal sediments increased degradation of all herbicides in the water column (apart from 2,4-D) in comparison with standard (dark, no sediment) treatments. Less than 1% of the mass balances of herbicides were detected in the sediments, indicating the sediments were not an important “sink” for herbicides in the water column. Instead, the likely mechanism for increased degradation rates of 17–44% was due to differences in the microbial communities, including the possibility that coastal sediments in the tanks introduced a more natural, wider diversity, including more taxa capable of utilising the herbicides as a substrate. Although not quantified, the sediment-associated communities may have “seeded” the water column with taxa capable of degrading dissolved herbicides. Previous studies in freshwater have demonstrated more rapid (~3-fold) loss of atrazine and metolachlor in the presence of natural sediments, attributing this to more rapid biodegradation as well as sequestration by the sediments [44]. Up to 10% of the herbicides were physically associated with sediments in that study, highlighting differences in the potential of sediments (affected by type) on removal of herbicides from the water column and their potential bioavailability. The inclusion of sterile sediment treatments allowed Rice et al., [44] to postulate that the presence of sediments may also influence non-biotic degradation rates. For example, humic acids often associated with sediments have been shown to increase photolysis and hydrolysis of a range of contaminants [23, 45, 46]. Different sediment types (and levels) will contain different concentrations of minerals, nutrients and humic acids which may further aid non-biotic degradation processes and differentially sequester herbicides from the water column [44]. Atrazine and metolachlor had similar rates of degradation (224 and 98 days, respectively) in the absence of sediments in a microcosm experiment mimicking tropical freshwater wetland environments [47]. Again, the addition of natural sediments significantly increased removal from the water column, further reinforcing the utility of these more realistic conditions in experiments for predicting environmental persistence.The combined effects of light and sedimentsThe differences in degradation rates under the four experimental conditions highlights the strong effects of light and the presence of sediments on herbicide persistence in seawater. The most rapid degradation was observed for all herbicides (apart from 2,4-D) in the presence of both moderate light and coastal sediments (2–10- fold more rapid). Only the persistence of 2,4-D opposed this trend, being 5-fold more persistent in the absence of light and sediment. This effect could have been caused by the presence of different microbial communities (discussed below) and is consistent with longer persistence in the presence of low light observed in our standard flask experiments [26]. Conditions in the light + sediment treatment were the most environmentally relevant experimental degradation conditions applied and the herbicide half-lives obtained under these conditions represent the most reliable estimates for herbicide persistence in tropical marine waters available.Potential role of bacteria and nutrientsThe long persistence of herbicides we report could be related to the limited capacity of natural microorganisms to metabolise the herbicides in the presence of other carbon sources and to the relatively low concentrations of the herbicides in solution. Thouland et al. [48], also described how the fate of chemicals in degradation studies are strongly influenced by the original inoculum used, largely depending on cell density, microbial diversity, and whether or not the microbial community may have been pre-exposed to the test chemical. Although the natural microbial populations used in the current experiment may have been previously exposed to low concentrations of these herbicides, in the tank experiments (as in the natural environment) they are likely to have access to a more abundant and diverse array of carbon sources (both dissolved in the seawater and associated with sediments) that may be more easily assimilated [49]. The nutrients in the tanks by the end of the experiment were similar to the relatively low concentrations reported for inshore waters of the GBR [30]. While the NH4, PO4 and NO2 concentrations were similar between the light and sediment treatments, NO2 + NO3 was 3–10-fold higher in the dark treatments, indicating impacts of light on nutrient cycling (e.g. NO3 concentrations can be influenced by microbial populations responding to light or can slowly degrade in the presence of light [50]) that may contribute to differences in microbial activity and potentially the more rapid degradation of 2,4-D in the dark. Future studies should specifically address the effects of nutrients on herbicide persistence in seawater. The active growth of bacterial communities in low-nutrient systems such as seawater is supported by the ability of most bacteria to adapt to a range of carbon sources [51]. However, the specific enzymatic pathways for metabolising complex organics like pesticides may only be induced above a “utilization threshold”, often in the range of 1–100 μg l-1 [51] and degradation may instead occur due to a slow, non-specific co-metabolism process [52]. The concentrations of herbicides applied in the current study were low in comparison to many studies and the microbial communities are less likely to induce herbicide metabolism of these low concentrations when other carbon sources are available. Concentrations of herbicides in situ are usually lower still (rarely above 10 μg l-1) underscoring the importance of degradation studies for risk assessment mimicking natural concentrations as closely as possible. The total number of water-borne bacteria was not affected by the presence of light or sediments (S6 Table); however, identifying the mechanistic pathways contributing to differences in persistence was beyond the scope of this study and could only be identified by: (i) quantifying all bacteria, including sediment-associated and biofilm bacteria; (ii) quantifying the genes related to the biodegradation pathways and (iii) a comprehensive analysis of transformation products [1].Environmental relevanceDespite the more rapid degradation observed for most herbicides in the presence of light and sediments, the half-lives of PSII herbicides were still > 100 days for diuron, atrazine and hexazinone, which helps explain their year-round presence in waterways of tropical Queensland [17]. The presence and concentration of these herbicides in the coastal zone is therefore more likely to be influenced by water exchange/dilution rather than degradation in the months following flood plumes. Even in the presence of light and sediments, the half-life of tebuthiuron was almost 3 years, indicating that this herbicide is very persistent in seawater. Tebuthiuron is commonly applied to control tree growth on grazing lands in the catchments of the southern GBR and its long persistence may contribute to detection in ~90% of water samples from this region [53]. The strong correlation of herbicides with freshwater plumes, which can extend for considerable distances along the coast, may limit the dilution of herbicides during the first weeks of a flood plume [16, 54]. Herbicide transport into the marine environment in river plumes also raises the question of relative persistence in fresh vs marine waters. The results from the present study indicate persistence of herbicides may be longer in seawater than freshwater [55, 56], but comparisons between studies are likely to be misleading as relative persistence has not been experimentally tested under similar conditions. Since herbicide degradation is largely dominated by biotic processes [1], the effects of light, sediments (including nutrients), temperature and salinity on degradation rates are highly likely due to influences on bacterial community structure and population densities [57].Degradation was more rapid for all herbicides tested under these more environmentally relevant conditions than we previously reported from standard OECD- style flask experiments [26]. While the standard flask experiments provide repeatable conditions that enable reliable comparisons between laboratories and contaminants, half-lives from flask experiments may not be suitable for application in risk assessments. This is especially the case where unrealistically high concentrations of contaminant are tested in the presence of additional nutrients and inoculated with highly enriched and active microbial consortia (e.g. from wastewater plants and alike) [49]. Even when standard flasks studies are conducted to better simulate natural conditions they are often not performed for sufficient time to enable half-life calculations [26]. The static, yet open large tank experiments here, conducted in the presence of natural sediments and variable light and temperature provide conditions much more representative of those in the natural environment.The current study helps address an important knowledge gap on pesticide transformation for regulators by measuring herbicide degradation at low concentrations in coastal seawater [1]. Future research needs to test the persistence of a wider range of pesticides at low concentrations in natural coastal waters of varying salinities, nutrients and in the presence of different sediment types. In particular, research into the mobility, transport, degradation and toxicity of newly registered or alternative herbicides is lacking and risks posed by these herbicides to the marine environment remains unclear [58]. Attention to the metabolites (transformation products) of herbicide degradation, which may be persistent and toxic, is also needed [1]. Herbicide metabolites were not specifically addressed in the current study due to the lack of available standards for quantification, although the presence of DEA and DIA confirmed the role of bacteria in the degradation of atrazine [37, 59]. In combination, new advances in LC-MS techniques and quantitative molecular tools should enable far more comprehensive analysis of transformation products, degradation pathways and potential in the laboratory and in situ.Supporting InformationS1 Table.

The presence of valvular calcifications is considered a manifestation of inflammation and diffuse atherosclerosis. In particular, mitral annular calcification (MAC) and aortic valve calcification (AVC) are associated with independent cardiovascular risk factors; such as coronary artery calcification, incidence of cardiovascular disease events, and both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality [1–6].Valvular calcification has been associated with coronary plaque burden when observed using coronary angiography or non-contrast computed tomography [7,8]. However, the impact of multiple heart valve calcium deposits on plaque components and the vulnerability of the coronary arteries are not yet known. Assessment using virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) is widely performed and is a very useful tool for observing plaque characteristics in current clinical practice settings.Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the presence of valvular calcification and the plaque morphology and/or vulnerability of target lesions using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and VH-IVUS in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).MethodsStudy populationThis was an exploratory study utilizing retrospective analysis. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board at Chung-Ang University Hospital and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Owing to the retrospective nature of the study, the need for verbal or written patient consent was waived. However, patient records and informations were anonymized and deidentified prior to analysis.We retrospectively assessed the records of 280 patients with suspected or known CAD who underwent both TTE and coronary angiography with VH-IVUS within a one month period (S1 Table). Finally, a propensity score-matched cohort of 192 patients (n = 96 in each group) was chosen as the primary data set. Standard coronary risk factors were collected including age, sex, hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, or current use of antihypertensive medication), diabetes mellitus (treatment for diabetes mellitus, a fasting serum glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, or hemoglobin A1C ≥ 6.5mg/dL), hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol level ≥240 mg/dL or treatment for hypercholesterolemia), current smoking status (within the past 12 months), and family history of CAD (myocardial infarction in a first-degree relative aged <60 years).Angiographic analysisCoronary angiography was performed after an intracoronary injection of 200 μg nitroglycerin. All angiograms were analyzed using an automated edge-detection algorithm (AI-1000 century, GE) and standard protocols. Culprit lesion length, reference vessel diameter, minimal lumen diameter, percent diameter stenosis, and the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade were measured from end-diastolic frames. Target lesions for angiography were identified according to the clinical presentation of the patient and electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, or myocardial perfusion on angiographic findings.Echocardiographic analysisA complete 2-dimensional (2-D) echocardiogram at rest was obtained for all patients using an iE33 Xmatrix (Philips, Andover, MA, USA) with a 3.5-MHz transducer. All standard views were obtained during quiet respiration. Three experienced sonographers conducted the sonographic measurements while two cardiologists (NBS, JEK) who were blinded to the clinical and laboratory information evaluated the results. MAC was defined as a highly reflective area with acoustic shadowing located at the junction of the atrioventricular groove and the posterior mitral leaflet on the parasternal long-axis, apical 4-chamber, or parasternal short-axis views (Fig 1A) [9].

Representative images of valvular calcification and coronary artery calcification(white arrows).Transthoracic echocardiography showed mitral annular calcification (A) and aortic valve calcification (B). VH-IVUS demonstrated mild and severe coronary calcification. Mild valvular calcification revealed the prominent fibrous (green color) plaque components (C), while severe valvular calcification showed densely calcified plaque (D).              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165885.g001AVC was defined as bright, dense echoes greater than or equal to 1 mm in size on one or more cusps (Fig 1B) (2). The severity of aortic or mitral valve leaflet and annular calcification was graded as ‘mild to moderate’ when deposits were thin (1~4 mm) and as ‘severe’ when deposits were thick (>4mm). The thickness of the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets were measured as the mean of three consecutive 2-D measurements, as previously described [10].Grayscale and virtual histology intravascular ultrasound imagingA commercially available VH-IVUS system (Volcano Therapeutics, Rancho Cordova, CA) and 20 MHz transducer were used for all IVUS examinations. The IVUS catheter was advanced 10 mm distal to the target lesion and imaging was performed back to the aorto-ostial junction using an ECG-gated automatic pullback device. Studies were recorded on electronic media for offline analysis at a later stage. Gray-scale IVUS analysis was performed according to the criteria laid out by the American College of Cardiology clinical expert consensus document on IVUS and included the external elastic membrane, the lumen, plaque and media (external elastic membrane minus lumen) areas [11]. VH-IVUS imaging was performed prior to any intervention and after intracoronary administration of 200 μg nitroglycerin. VH-IVUS analysis classified the intracoronary plaques as fibrotic tissue (FT), fibrofatty (FF), necrotic core (NC), and dense calcium (DC). Plaque compositions were expressed with colors (green for FT, yellow for FF, red for NC, and white for DC). Measurements were performed over the entire length. Virtual histology thin-capped fibroatheroma (VH-TCFA) was defined as NC >10% of the plaque area with a plaque burden >40% and in contact with the lumen for ≥3 image slices [12]. The remodeling index was defined as the ratio of external elastic membrane cross-sectional area at the target lesion to that at the proximal reference. Positive remodeling was defined as a remodeling index >1.05 [13].Statistical analysisContinuous data were presented as the mean ± SD or median (interquartile range). Categorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages. Groups were compared for categorical data or frequency of events using Fisher’s exact test or the χ2 test; and for continuous variables using an unpaired Student's t-test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and ANOVA. Post hoc testing was performed using Tukey’s test or the Steel-Dwass method for variables with and without normal distribution. Propensity score-matched analysis was used to adjust for differences between the groups. Age, gender, risk factors, clinical diagnosis, and angiographic findings were adjusted for the propensity score-matched model. After propensity score-matched analysis, we analyzed the baseline covariates between the groups. All tests were two-sided, and a P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (Version 20.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).ResultsClinical and angiographic findingsClinical patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. Of 280 patients, valvular calcification was observed in 152 patients, while 128 patients had no detectable valvular calcification. The mean age of patients in any calcification group was higher than that of patients without valvular calcification (p<0.001). Any calcification group included a greater number of diabetic (p = 0.014) and hypertensive (p = 0.030) patients than those with no detectable valvular calcification. After propensity score-matched analysis, clinical characteristics between groups did not differ. Smoking status, hyperlipidemia, creatinine, and body mass indices were similar in both groups. Both clinical presentation and extent of CAD were also found to be similar. Quantitative angiographic analysis showed that the reference vessel diameter was larger in any calcification group than in those patients without calcification (p = 0.001). However; lesion length, minimal lumen diameter, and diameter stenosis showed no differences between the two groups. After propensity score-matched analysis, the reference vessel diameters were found to be of similar length (p = 0.47).

Clinical and angiographic characteristics.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165885.t001Echocardiographic and intravascular ultrasound measurementsThe study population was divided into groups according to the presence and severity of calcification in the aortic or mitral valve leaflets and MAC. At least one valvular calcification was observed in 152 patients, while 128 patients had no detectable valvular calcification. Of the 152 patients with any calcification, both AVC and MAC were observed in 52 patients, while isolated calcifications were observed in 100 patients (MAC alone, 31 patients; AVC alone, 69 patients). Calcification was classified as mild to moderate in 76 patients, while the remainder of the group was classified as severe.Gray-scale IVUS measurements are presented in Table 2. The vessel size, lesion length, and the minimal lumen area were similar in both groups. The average plaque burden was larger in any valvular calcification group than in those without calcification (p = 0.036), however, the size was found to be similar after propensity score-matched analysis (p = 0.6930). Although the remodeling index of minimal lumen area site was similar, positive remodeling was prominent at the maximal NC site in both groups (p = 0.88). Positive remodeling was observed in 61.2% (93/152) of patients in any calcification group and 57% (73/128) of patients in those without calcification (p = 0.38).

However, after propensity score-matched analysis, only % DC was larger in the valvular calcification group than in the group without calcification (p = 0.029). The fibrotic plaque was larger at the maximal NC site in the group without calcification (p<0.0001) (Table 2). With regards to the severity of calcification, % mean NC was higher (p = 0.049) and % mean DC was larger (p = 0.003) at the lesion segment in the severe calcification group. In addition, the NC and DC of the maximal NC site were also found to be larger in the severe calcification group (p = 0.042, p = 0.006, respectively). The % fibrotic plaque was higher in the group without calcification (p<0.0001) when compared to the group with calcification. In the calcification group, the NC and DC were similar between the group with isolated calcification and that with combined AVC and MAC. After propensity score-matched analysis, only the DC area (p = 0.008) and % DC (p = 0.047) were higher at the maximal NC site when comparing the three groups (Table 3, Fig 1C and 1D).

VH-IVUS analysis depending on valvular calcification after propensity score matching analysis.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165885.t003Overall, VH-TCFA was identified in 38.6% (108/280) of the total study population. The incidence of VH-TCFA was higher depending on the complexity of calcification: 34.4% (44/128) in patients with no detectable calcification, 33% (33/100) in patients with isolated calcification, and 63.5% (31/52) in patients with combined AVC and MAC. Patients with combined AVC and MAC were found to have more VH-TCFAs than those with either no detectable valvular calcification or isolated calcification (p = 0.003). The association between a higher incidence of VH-TCFAs and the complexity of calcification was confirmed after propensity score-matched analysis (p = 0.0064) (Fig 2A, S2 Table).

Incidence of VH-TCFA according to the complexity (A) and severity (B) of valvular calcification. A: Patients with combined aortic and mitral valve calcification had more VH-TCFAs than those with either no detectable valvular calcification or isolated calcification. B: Patients with severe valvular calcification had a higher incidence of VH-TCFAs than those with either no detectable valvular calcification or mild to moderate calcification.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165885.g002According to the severity of valvular calcification, VH-TCFA occurred in 34.4% (44/128) of patients with no detectable calcification, 28.9% (22/76) of patients with mild to moderate calcification, and 55.3% (42/76) of patients with severe calcification. VH-TCFA was observed more frequently in patients with severe valvular calcification than in those with either no detectable valvular calcification or mild to moderate calcification (p = 0.002). After propensity score-matched analysis, the incidence of VH-TCFAs was higher in patients with severe valvular calcification (p = 0.0130) (Fig 2B, S2 Table).DiscussionThere were three major findings in the present study: that valvular calcification was frequently combined (MAC and AVC) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS); that the presence of valvular calcification was an indicator of lesion complexity with more calcified coronary plaque and VH-TCFA, suggestive of lesion instability; and that both the complexity and severity of valvular calcification were associated with a high frequency of VH-TCFA occurrence.The relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and CAD was first suggested in the Framingham study using an epidemiological approach [14,15]. Both invasive and non-invasive techniques are used to explore the correlation between cardiovascular risk factors and morphological characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques [16,17–19]. Two-dimensional echocardiography is the most commonly used imaging technique for the evaluation of cardiac function. Echocardiographic measurements provide powerful prognostic information for cardiovascular outcomes, such as the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy, aortic stenosis, and left ventricular ejection fraction [20,21]. Moreover, cardiovascular risk may be stratified using standard TTE, by means of the calcification score index, the Duke score, the Framingham risk score, and so forth [21–23]. While the prevalence of AVC and MAC does increase with age, it is also strongly related to traditional cardiovascular risk factors; including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome [6–8]. As an invasive modality, IVUS provides tomographic visualization and quantifies atherosclerotic plaque volume and burden. The major advantage of VH-IVUS is its practicality for use in a clinical setting and real-time assessment of plaque morphology. In the present study, valvular calcification was made up of both MAC and AVC in patients of an older age and those with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Valvular calcification was frequently combined in ACS, and severe calcification of the cardiac valves was observed in half of these patients.It has previously been shown that valvular calcification is not a merely a bystander to disease, but rather an indication of more vulnerable plaques [16]. Coronary calcification has been shown to be predictive of cardiovascular disease mortality; whereas calcification of the carotid arteries, thoracic aorta, and iliac arteries are predictive of total mortality [24]. Calcification of the aortic valve has a strong association with coronary microvascular endothelial dysfunction and overall coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden as well as MAC [7,8,25]. ACS can be the first manifestation of coronary artery atherosclerosis, thus making the identification of plaques at high risk of complication an important component of strategies to reduce casualties. Approximately 60% of clinically evident plaque ruptures originate from the inflamed TCFA [26]. A previous pathological study demonstrated a relationship between lesion instability and the size of NCs or the presence of TCFAs [27]. Furthermore, the presence of arterial calcium deposits causes compliance mismatch and creates stress failure at the plaque surface, thereby increased the risk of rupture [28].In this study, the presence of valvular calcification was associated not only with increased calcification, but also with heightened lesion instability in the treated coronary artery segment in the form of VH-TCFA with increased calcium density. Moreover, the combined presence of AVC and MAC and the severity of valvular calcification were significantly associated with vulnerable plaques. Recognizing valvular calcification may help identify individuals with lesion complexity and plaque instability of the coronary arteries, which require aggressive medical intervention such as high-dose statin therapy.Study limitationsThis study had several limitations. First, this was an observational study with a small sample size. Second, a high proportion of the study population included high risk patients (86% of patients had ACS). Therefore, these results should be applied to the general population with caution. Third, although patients with culprit lesions and prominent thrombi burden were excluded, the presence of a thrombus overlying a culprit lesion could reduce the ability of IVUS to assess underlying plaque characteristics. Thrombectomy itself can affect plaque morphology and the accuracy of the data. Fourth, scant valvular calcification may not be detected due to the low resolution of echocardiography. Fifth, we did not assess the clinical outcome of valvular calcification. Further investigation is necessary to evaluate the clinical impact of valvular calcification. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the relationship between valvular calcification and plaque characteristics of the coronary artery assessed using radiofrequency intravascular ultrasound.ConclusionsThis study found a significant relationship between valvular calcifications and VH-IVUS assessment of TCFA. A high complexity and severity of valvular calcification indicated greater atherosclerotic disease complexity (increased calcification of coronary plaques) as well as vulnerable coronary plaques (higher incidence of VH-TCFA). Further studies are required to evaluate the clinical impact of valvular calcification.Supporting InformationS1 Table. Patients’ raw data.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0165885.s001(XLTX)S2 Table.

However, their dysfunction causes cancer initiation and progression, making them attractive targets for anticancer therapy [1]. Among these factors are the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR), which constitute key elements in tumor growth and dissemination [2].EGFR is a member of human EGF receptor (HER) family of tyrosine kinases whose dysregulated signaling is involved in many cancers of epithelial origin, accounting for 80% of all solid tumors [3]. EGFR overexpression or constitutive activation has been associated with increased tumor proliferation, survival, migration, and metastasis. Binding of EGF ligand to EGFR causes dimerization and auto-phosphorylation of the receptor, triggering a cascade of downstream signaling pathways such as Ras-MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and STAT [4]. The majority of solid cancers also overexpress VEGF, a potent stimulator of angiogenesis, whose receptor VEGFR2 plays a key role in transmitting signals for proliferation, differentiation, and migration of endothelial cells (ECs). VEGF also promotes microvascular hyperpermeability, which can both precede and accompany angiogenesis, favoring tumor stroma formation and tumor cell spreading [5]. Although acting primarily on vascular endothelium, VEGF produced by tumors operates in an autocrine loop on VEGF receptors expressed by tumor cells [6].In a tumor hypoxic environment, stabilized hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) bind to VEGF promoter and activate its transcription [7]. Interestingly, hypoxia-induced activation of HIF is accompanied by translational upregulation of EGFR and prolonged EGFR signaling [8]. Moreover, EGF and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), two potent EGFR ligands, have been shown to induce VEGF expression in cell culture models. Furthermore, different classes of EGFR inhibitors such as mAbs directed against the external ligand-binding site of the receptor, including cetuximab and panitumumab, in addition to small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) directed against the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, like gefitinib, erlotinib and lapatinib, were able to attenuate VEGF expression in vitro and in vivo [9]. On the other hand, VEGF upregulation contribute to resistance to EGFR inhibition, independent of EGFR signaling [2]. Hence, VEGF signaling is up-regulated by EGFR expression whereas inhibition of VEGF-related pathways is thought to contribute to the mechanism of action for agents targeting the EGFR.Although an increased association between VEGF and EGFR signaling pathways has been identified in various solid tumors, it is still poorly established in hematological malignancies. In fact, angiogenesis and its mediator, VEGF, were thought to minimally contribute to the pathogenesis of liquid tumors where EGFR has not been shown to be expressed. In contrary, elevated levels of VEGF and increased angiogenesis have been observed in most hematological malignancies and hence contribute to their pathogenesis [10]. Indeed, VEGF was found to trigger growth, survival, or migration of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma cells through autocrine mechanisms [11, 12]. Recent studies demonstrated that human EGF-like receptor 2 (HER-2/Neu), structurally related to EGFR, is overexpressed in one-third of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients, who display resistance to conventional chemotherapies [13]. Moreover, another study demonstrated that one-third of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients express EGFR, which is associated with poor clinical outcome. Furthermore, EGFR has been also detected in some leukemic cell lines [14]. Finally, malignant cells of most multiple myeloma patients overexpress a number of EGFRs and their ligands, which reinforces a role for this GF family in the pathophysiology of the disease [15].In this study, we investigated the interaction of EGFR and VEGF-A pathways in the context of two hematological in vitro models: THP1, a human monocytic leukemia, and Raji, a Burkitt’s lymphoma, cell lines. We examined EGFR-induced VEGF-A production, VEGF-A feedback through VEGFR2, signaling pathways and cellular processes involved such as ERK, AKT, Ca2+ release, and ROS production.Materials and MethodsCell lines and culture conditionsTHP-1 and Raji cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI; Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Gibco, Life Technologies) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (PS; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2.ReagentsEGF (Sigma) was used at 20 ng/ml, unless otherwise specified. The following inhibitors were used: EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor Tyrphostin (AG1478), VEGFR2 inhibitor Dimethylhydrazine (DMH4), also called 6-[4-[2-(4-Morpholinyl)ethoxy]phenyl]-3-phenylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine, PI3K inhibitor 2-(4-Morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride (LY294002), Phospholipase C inhibitor 1-[6-[[(17β)-3-Methoxyestra-1,3,5[10]-trien-17-yl)amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U73122), ROS inhibitor N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). All Inhibitors were purchased from Sigma (USA).siRNA StudiesOne day before siRNA transfection, cells were plated at 2x105/mL in 12-well plates in DMEM cell growth media without antibiotics. Sense siRNAs targeting human VEGFR2 5'-CAAAUCUCAACGUGUCACU-3' (ON-TARGET plus SMART pool, catalogue no. L-003114-00-0005), and anti-sense VEGFR2 siRNA 5'-AGUGACACGUUGAGAUUUG-3' (catalogue no. D-001810-10-05) were purchased from Dharmacon. Each siRNA was used at 20 nM concentration and transfected into cells using the lipofectamine reagent according to manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Effects of siRNA on protein expression were assessed by western blot at 72h post transfection.RNA extractionTotal RNAs from cultured cells were isolated using TriPure kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche, USA). The quantity of RNA was measured using the Eppendorf Biophotometer Plus Spectrophotometer. RNA purity was assessed using the absorbance ratio of 260 to 280 nm, where a value of 1.8–2.0 indicated good quality RNA.RT-PCRReverse transcription was carried out on 1μg of RNA, using the qScript cDNA™ SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences, USA), according to manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting cDNA was then used for PCR using the following primers: VEGFR1, F: 5’- AAGAGAGCTTCCGTAAGGCG-3’, R: 5’-GCATCCTCTTCAGTTACGTCC-3’, VEGFR2, F: 5´-GGAAGCTCCTGAAGATCTGT-3´, R: 5´-GAGGATATTTCGTGCCGCGC-3´, VEGFR3, F: 5’-AGTCACACGTCATCGACACC-3’, R: 5’-CTTCCTGTTGACCAAGAGCG-3’, EGFR, F: 5´-AGGAGCTGCCCATGAGAAAT-3´, R: 5´-ATTGGGACAGCTTGGATCAC-3´, GAPDH, F: 5´-GTGTTCCTACCCCCAATGTGT-3´, R: 5´-ATTGTCATACCAGGAAATGAGC-3´. The PCR conditions were 95°C for 5min, then 40 cycles each of denaturation at 95°C for 1min, annealing at 60°C for 45s, extension at 72°C for 30s and a final extension step at 72°C for 20min. Results were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Negative control (water without DNA) was used to check for contamination.Protein extraction and quantificationProteins from cultured cells were homogenized with RIPA buffer (50mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Germany). The lysates were incubated for 15min on ice followed by centrifugation at 11000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C and protein concentrations determined using Bradford Assay.Western blottingProtein samples were mixed with loading buffer (Lamaelli and β-Mercapto-ethanol), heated at 95°C for 10min and then loaded into the wells of stacking gel and run until bromophenol blue reached the bottom of the gel. Gels were then transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Germany) at 4°C at 80–100 volts for 1h. The membrane was then blocked in 5% BSA, prepared in wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), for 2h at RT. Detection of the protein of interest was achieved by probing the membrane with the primary antibody of interest. Primary antibodies used were monoclonal anti-EGFR, p-EGFR, VEGFR2 (sc-6251), p-VEGFR2, VEGF-A (sc-152), ERK1, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, p38, p-p38, AKT, p-AKT. All antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz and used at 1:1000 dilution. It’s worth noting that ERK1 is detected as 1 band on the western-blot whereas 2 bands corresponds to either ERK1/2 or p-ERK1/2. The phosphorylation sites recognized when using p-EGFR, p-VEGFR2, p-ERK, p-p38 and p-AKT corresponds to Tyr1068, Tyr1175, Tyr204, Tyr182, and Ser473; respectively. Actin antibody was used to ensure equal loading of samples (1:3,000 dilution). After several washes, the membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (diluted at 1:10,000) for 1h at RT. Protein bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent detection system (FluorChem E FE0324). Molecular weight markers enabled the determination of protein sizes. Intensity of bands was then determined by densitometry, using ImageJ software.ELISAConditioned media was employed to quantitatively measure VEGF-A using a sandwich enzymatic method with specific anti-VEGF-A antibodies (R&D Systems). The supernatant was collected and used for ELISA according to manufacturer's guidelines. Briefly, cells were grown to confluence in media supplemented with 10% FBS which was then replaced with serum-free medium. A total of 200 μl of cell supernatant were incubated with 50 μl of assay diluent for 2h at room temperature in a 96-well plate coated with a monoclonal antibody against VEGF165. After three washes, a conjugate consisting of a polyclonal VEGF antibody and horseradish peroxidase was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After addition of a color reagent, absorbance was measured at 450 nm in a Thermo-Max microplate reader. For standardization, serial dilutions of recombinant human VEGF165 were assayed at the same time.Calcium measurementTHP-1 or Raji cells were loaded with the calcium-sensitive dye Fluo-3/AM and free intracellular calcium was determined with a fluorometer (LS50B fluorescence spectrometer, Perkin Elmer, USA). Calcium concentration was calculated using the equation: [Ca2+] = {(dF–Fmin) / (Fmax–dF)} * Kd where dF is the observed fluorescence, Fmin is the fluorescence at low Ca2+ (5 mM EGTA), Fmax is the fluorescence at high Ca2+ (8 μM ionomycin), and Kd being 390 nM for Fluo-3/AM. Values for Fmin and Fmax were obtained at the end of each experiment. Peak values were recorded and plateau phases calculated as the area under the curve, starting at the peak and up to 200s thereafter, and expressed as arbitrary units.Assessment of ROS productionThis has been performed as previously described [16]. Briefly, THP-1 or Raji cell lines were incubated at 37°C for 20 min with 20 mM 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) (Molecular Probes, USA). After labeling, cells were treated, and production of ROS was then assessed every 10 min by measuring DCF emission at 525 nm; using a fluorometer (LS50B fluorescence spectrometer, Perkin Elmer, USA). Results were expressed as relative mean fluorescence intensity ±SEM.Statistical analysisResults are expressed as individual data or as the mean±SEM. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Student's t-test in order to determine statistical significance. The p value was determined and values for p<0.05, p<0.001, p<0.0001 (*, **, ***; respectively) were considered significant. Microsoft Excel and GraphPad softwares were used to perform statistical analysis.ResultsTHP1 and Raji cell lines express EGFR and VEGFR2Recent studies demonstrated that EGFR is expressed in hematological malignancies [13]. Similarly, VEGFR2 was shown to be selectively expressed on endothelial cells, but is also found on certain leukemias and lymphomas [15]. In this study, EGFR and VEGFR2 were examined in two hematological in vitro models: THP1 and Raji, a human monocytic leukemia and a Burkitt’s lymphoma cell lines; respectively.In order to study whether EGFR and VEGFR2 could induce any signaling pathway in THP1 and Raji cell lines, their expression was first explored at the transcriptional and translational levels. Indeed, both EGFR and VEGFR2 mRNA and protein levels were confirmed to be highly expressed in these cell lines, by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively (Fig 1B and 1C), similar to monocytes positive control, but unlike Jurkat cells which showed complete absence of expression, and considered as negative controls. It’s worth noting that VEGFR1 and VEGFR3 were found to be not expressed in those cell lines (Fig 1A).

Western-blot results showed a significant increase in p-EGFR levels after 15 seconds of EGF stimulation in the two cell lines (Fig 2A), indicating that EGFR is activated by ligand binding and is therefore functional. This activation of EGFR protein expression was maintained after 20 minutes of stimulation. In addition, a significant increase in intracellular VEGF-A protein levels was revealed after 1 minute of EGF stimulation (Fig 2A), which peaked after 5min, in both cell lines. Moreover, stimulation of Raji or THP1 cells by 20ng/ml EGF resulted in a significant increase in the levels of secreted VEGF-A, as measured by ELISA (Fig 2B). The secreted VEGF levels reached a maximum after 6 or 3 hours of EGF stimulation in THP1 or Raji cells; respectively (Fig 2B), demonstrating a time dependent VEGF induction by EGFR.

Stimulation with EGF showed a significant and immediate increase in the phosphorylation levels of p-AKT, p-ERK and p-p38 in both cell lines (Fig 3A). Indeed, p-AKT levels peaked ~10 min after treatment in THP1 cells, whereas p-ERK and p-p38 reached their maximum levels after ~20 minutes. However, a more prominent and earlier response was observed in Raji cells where p-AKT peaked after ~5min of stimulation whereas only 10min were needed for p-ERK and p-p38 to reach their maximum levels (Fig 3A). In order to confirm our data, EGFR was blocked using the inhibitor Tyrphostin (AG1478) which resulted in a reduction in the expression of pERK, pAKT, and p-p38 (Fig 3B).

Effect of EGFR-induced VEGF on AKT, ERK and p38.A total of 106 THP1 or Raji cells/well were cultured in the presence of 20ng/ml EGF and the phosphorylation levels of AKT, ERK and p38 were analyzed by Western blot. (A) EGF was treated for the indicated time intervals. Phosphorylation levels of p-AKT, p-ERK and p-p38 increased significantly after EGF stimulation in both THP1 (Left) and Raji (Right) cell lines. (B) In order to measure p-Akt, p-ERK and p-p38, EGFR was blocked using 5μM AG1478 inhibitor for 20min and cells were then stimulated by EGF at 20ng/ml for 10min, 20min, 30min or 5min, 10min, 20min in THP1 or Raji cell lines, respectively. The expression of pAKT, pERK, and p38 was found to be downregulated, using western-blot. It’s worth noting that ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 are detected as 2 bands on the western-blot corresponding to ERK1 and ERK2 or their phosphorylated isoforms. Results are representatives of four independent experiments (n = 4), for each time point and treatment condition.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165876.g003On the other hand, stimulation with EGF showed a significant and immediate increase, within 1min, in the phosphorylation levels of p-VEGFR2 in both cell lines, which peaked at ~5–10 min after treatment (Fig 4A). However, pre-incubation of THP1 or Raji cells with 20μM DMH4, a selective VEGFR2 inhibitor, resulted in a significant decrease in EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK and AKT, but not p38 (Fig 4B). This suggests that EGFR-induced VEGF will bind VEGFR2 in order to activate the downstream signaling pathways that drive its induction, in an autocrine feedback mechanism. Furthermore, similar inhibition of ERK and AKT phosphorylation, but not p38, was found using antibodies (Fig 4C) or siRNA (Fig 4D) directed against VEGFR2, which confirms an autocrine feedback mechanism in both cell lines through membranous, but not intracellular, VEGFR2.

Effect of EGFR-induced VEGF on phosphorylation of VEGFR2, AKT and ERK.A total of 106 THP1 or Raji cells/well were cultured in the presence of 20ng/ml EGF. (A) EGF stimulation increased very early the phosphorylation levels of p-VEGFR2 in THP1 (Left) or Raji (Right) cell lines, which peaked at ~5–10 min after treatment. (B) In order to measure p-Akt, p-ERK and p-p38, VEGFR2 was blocked using 20μM DMH4 inhibitor for 1h30min and cells were then stimulated by EGF at 20ng/ml for 10min, 20min, 30min or 5min, 10min, 20min in THP1 or Raji cell lines, respectively. Phosphorylation of AKT and ERK, but not p38, was diminished when the cell lines were pre-incubated with DMH4. (C) Similarly, phosphorylation of AKT and ERK, but not p38, was inhibited when cells were pre-incubated for 1h with 2μg/ml anti-VEGFR2 antibodies. (D) siRNA (20nM) against VEGFR2, left after transfection for 72h, caused a decrease in the phosphorylation levels of AKT and ERK, but not p38. It’s worth noting that ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 are detected as 2 bands on the western-blots corresponding to ERK1 and ERK2 or their phosphorylated isoforms. However, when ERK1 antibody is used, only 1 band appears on the blot. Results are representatives of four independent western blot experiments (n = 4).              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165876.g004Activation of ERK and AKT is PI3K-dependent while PLC regulates p38In addition to the canonical GRB2-SOS-RAS pathway, a PLC and a PI3K-mediated ERK activation exist. In order to determine which signaling pathway is involved in EGF-induced VEGF activation, THP1 or Raji cell lines were pretreated with a PI3K or PLC inhibitor, LY294002 or U73122; respectively, prior to EGF stimulation (Fig 5). Western blot analysis showed that PI3K inhibition by LY294002 resulted in a significant decrease in both p-ERK and p-AKT levels in both cell lines (Fig 5) whereas it did not have any effect on p-p38. On the other hand, the PLC inhibitor U73122 significantly reduced p-p38 levels in both cell lines while p-AKT and p-ERK levels were not affected. Therefore, we conclude that ERK and AKT activation depend on PI3K pathway while p38 activation depends on PLC pathway.

In order to measure p-Akt, p-ERK and p-p38, cells were then treated with EGF at 20ng/ml for 10min, 20min, 30min or 5min, 10min, 20min in THP1 or Raji cell lines, respectively. Western blot analysis showing that EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK and AKT was inhibited in the presence of LY294002 whereas that of p38 was inhibited by U73122. Results are representatives of three independent experiments (n = 3) for each treatment condition.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165876.g005In summary, results of VEGFR2 inhibition showed that the greater part of ERK and AKT phosphorylation was triggered by VEGF feedback. Since ERK activation by VEGFR2 is not through GRB2-SOS-RAS and since VEGFR2 is strongly implicated in PI3K and PKC pathways, we may assume that PI3K pathway, through VEGFR2 activation initiated by EGFR, is responsible for ERK and AKT activation. On the other hand, EGFR seems to be the sole activator of p38 via PLC pathway.Effect of EGF and VEGF on intracellular [Ca2+] and ROS productionSince p38 was found to be inhibited when PLC inhibitor U73122 was used, thus intracellular calcium is supposed to be released and therefore production of Calcium was measured within these cells. Intracellular Ca2+ and ROS are essential signaling mediators of growth factor receptors such as EGFR. The contribution of EGF and EGF-induced VEGF in the release of these intracellular messengers was examined in THP1 and Raji cell lines. Stimulation with 20ng/ml EGF for 1min resulted in a significant and rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentrations, in both cell lines. This surge of calcium was not affected by VEGFR2 inhibition using 20μM DMH4 (Fig 6).

In contrast to what was obtained for Ca, EGF-induced VEGF resulted in ROS production which was significantly reduced by VEGFR2 inhibition, using 20μM of DMH4 (Fig 7A and 7B). Moreover, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was used to inhibit ROS production followed by the measurement of pAKT, pERK and p-p38. Results showed a significant decrease in pAKT, pERK and p-p38 following the addition of the ROS inhibitor NAC (Fig 7C). These data confirm that EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK, AKT and p38 is affected when ROS production is blocked. Therefore, VEGFR2 is not implicated in Ca2+ release whereas it’s responsible for EGF-induced ROS production.

Close relationship and signaling between these factors exist which result in survival and resistance mechanisms that prevent efficient targeted therapy [18]. In addition, it has been recently reported that VEGF and its receptor are crucial targets in angiogenesis [19] and that combination therapy using siRNAs enhance the antitumor therapy in xenografts [20]. Despite the extensive amount of research devoted to EGFR and VEGF in solid tumors, little is known about their involvement in liquid tumors. Recent findings, however, have shown their importance in the pathophysiology of hematological malignancies [3, 13]. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms of interaction between EGFR and VEGFR signaling pathways in two hematological in vitro models: THP1 and Raji, a human monocytic leukemia and a Burkitt’s lymphoma cell lines; respectively. The expressed EGFR and VEGFR2 showed important signaling interplay in the two cell lines for the following reasons. (1) Upon activation by EGF, p-EGFR induced a significant increase in VEGF-A, which exerted a positive feedback on ERK and AKT initiated by EGFR through VEGFR2. (2) VEGF-A feedback was PI3K dependent and VEGF also boosted EGF-induced ROS production. (3) On the other hand, in response to EGF, p38 phosphorylation was PLC dependent whereas it was independent of VEGFR2.Conflicting reports exist about EGFR expression in hematological tumors [13, 21]. This study confirmed that both THP1 and Raji cell lines express EGFR at the mRNA and protein levels. This is in agreement with a recent study which detected EGFR transcripts in bone marrow and blood samples from acute monocytic leukemia (AML) M5 patients [14]. Moreover, we have demonstrated that VEGFR2 is detected at the transcriptional and translational levels in both cell lines. It’s important to note that VEGFR2 is expressed selectively, but not exclusively, on endothelial cells and that many tumors are known to express this receptor [6]. The first link between EGFR activity and VEGF expression was reported almost 20 years ago when it was shown that two EGFR ligands, EGF and TGFα, stimulated the expression of VEGF in glioma cells and in hyperproliferative keratinocytes [22]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that different classes of EGFR-targeting agents are able to attenuate VEGF expression [9]. In our study, EGF stimulated the phosphorylation of EGFR indicating responsive membranous EGFRs on both cell lines. EGF then induced the expression of VEGF-A, reflected by a significant increase of intracellular and secreted VEGF-A levels, in a time-dependent manner. Reaching a maximal VEGF-A response after 3-6h of stimulation may be explained by diffusion of the EGFR signal and/or possible negative feedback on VEGF induction. Lower extracellular VEGF levels found beyond this maximum indicated possible binding of secreted VEGF to VEGFR2 expressed on both THP1 and Raji cells.VEGF expression is regulated by MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades and at least three different types of transcription factors: STAT3, Sp1 and HIFs [23]. This study investigated EGFR activation of two MAPKs, ERK and p38, in addition to the most important downstream target of PI3K, i.e. AKT. In response to EGF, phosphorylation of the three proteins was fast and peaked within minutes (~5–10 min) in THP1 and Raji cells. Moreover, inhibition of VEGFR2 by the selective inhibitor DMH4 attenuated EGF-induced ERK and AKT phosphorylation, indicating that the greater part of the activating signal is VEGFR2 dependent. VEGF has been identified as an autocrine factor in several solid tumors and leukemias expressing VEGF receptors, promoting their survival, proliferation, and metastasis [6]. Furthermore, anti-VEGFR2 antibody and siRNA were also able to inhibit ERK and AKT activation. As suggested above, released VEGF could bind VEGFR2 as an autocrine positive feedback mechanism. Indeed, EGF-induced VEGF production triggered the signaling via VEGFR2 resulting in the amplification of ERK and AKT pathways, known to upregulate VEGF expression. A relevant study demonstrated an autocrine feed-forward loop in NSCLC cells in which tumor-derived VEGF stimulated VEGF production via VEGFR2-dependent activation of PI3K/ mTOR [24]. Moreover, direct phosphorylation of HIF-1α and Sp1 by ERK1/2 has been shown to induce transcription of VEGF [9, 25, 26].VEGFR2 is known to stimulate ERK via phosphorylation of PLC and subsequent activation of PKC, but not via GRB2-SOS-RAS as most other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) [27]. Moreover, a non-canonical ERK activation via PI3K pathway also exists [28]. While neither ERK nor AKT phosphorylation were affected by PLC inhibition, PI3K inhibitor abolished most of the pERK and pAKT. Our results imply that the larger part of pERK, induced by VEGFR2 feedback, is PI3K dependent. The minor ERK activation, initially stimulated by EGFR, is probably through the canonical pathway since inhibition of PKC or PI3K non-canonical pathways was ineffective in bringing pERK to basal levels. VEGFR2 is strongly implicated in activation of the PI3K pathway. AKT inhibition, observed following VEGFR2 inhibition, also diminished EGF-induced AKT phosphorylation to basal levels. Indeed, our data confirm that AKT pathway is initiated by EGFR and enhanced by VEGF feedback. Two mechanisms have been proposed to illustrate a possible involvement of PI3K in ERK activation. The first is Ras-dependent involving PI3K lipid products that may promote association of adaptor molecules such as Shc, Grb2, and Gab1 with the plasma membrane. The second involves PI3K activation of p21-activated kinase (PAK) via Rac to promote stimulation of Raf and MEK leading to ERK activation [28]. Furthermore, it has also been reported that VEGF-C promotes angiogenesis by induction of COX-2 in leukemic cells via the VEGFR3/JNK/AP-1 pathway [29]. In contrast, our study demonstrated that a crosstalk exists between EGFR and VEGFR2 and that VEGF-A via VEGFR2/AKT/ERK pathway are implicated in THP1 and Raji cell lines along with the involvement of ROS and Ca2+.On the other hand, p38 MAPK activation was not affected by VEGFR2 inhibition but was only dependent on EGFR. In agreement, p-p38 was diminished using PLC, but not PI3K, inhibitor. Additionally, EGF induced a surge in intracellular calcium concentrations independent of VEGFR2 feedback. Intracellular Ca2+ is an important signaling mediator of EGFR and an essential cofactor for PKC activation, whereby [Ca2+]i increase in response to EGF agrees with the fact that EGFR would activate p38 via PKC.Additionally, although substantial amounts of ROS were present in unstimulated THP1 and Raji cells, EGF-induced VEGF promoted ROS production that was significantly reduced by VEGFR2 inhibition. Recent evidence indicates that ROS may function as intracellular messenger in receptor signaling pathways. The most important multienzyme complex involved in the generation of ROS during signal transduction pathways is a membrane-bound NADPH oxidase which elevates ROS within few minutes after cell stimulation [30]. In endothelial cells, VEGF stimulates ROS production (superoxide anion and H2O2) via activation of NADPH oxidases. ROS produced by NADPH oxidase then inactivates the protein tyrosine phosphatases which negatively regulate VEGFR2 [31]. It’s worth noting that it’s already established that platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced ROS production requires the stimulation of PI3K to activate Rac1 which may mediate signaling between the PI3K product and the putative NADPH oxidase [30].It’s important to note that the levels of p-Akt, p-ERK, p-p38 and ROS were partially reduced under the variable inhibitory conditions. This suggests that other compensatory signaling pathways or other cross-talks with other receptors might be involved or activated. This remaining residual activity could have been obtained through second messengers or receptors (e.g. PLC, GPCR, etc…). In conclusion, the last decade has witnessed the approval of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for targeting of oncogenic signaling pathways. Generally, the clinical activity of these agents has been less than expected, in part due to feedback loops and cross-talks between different signaling pathways, thus the interest of inhibiting multiple pathways. The extensive degree of EGFR-VEGF(R) pathway cross-talk in many solid tumors rendered them a promising target for Vandetanib (ZD6474), the dual kinase inhibitor of EGFR and VEGFR [32]. Our study has revealed the interplay between EGFR and VEGFR in THP1 and Raji cells at the level of signaling pathways involved in survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Further studies need to evaluate the therapeutic advantage of their combined blockade in these tumors.Author ContributionsConceptualization: KZ NEZ.Data curation: LS NEZ.Formal analysis: LS NK BB KZ NEZ.Funding acquisition: NEZ KZ.Investigation: LS NEZ.Methodology: LS NK BB NEZ.Project administration: KZ NEZ.Resources: KZ BB NEZ.Supervision: KZ NEZ.Validation: LS NEZ.Visualization: KZ.Writing – original draft: KZ LS NEZ.Writing – review & editing: KZ NEZ NK.References1.

Every year, over 500,000 people die due to HBV-associated liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [2, 3]. Pegylated interferon-α (IFN-α) and various nucleos(t)ides are currently licensed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), but they rarely lead to cure [4]. Research on the development of new treatment options for CHB is urgently needed.The progress in HBV research is strongly dependent on the availability of suitable animal models. Except humans, HBV can infect only apes, tree shrews and macaques [5]. However, due to various restraints encountered using these primate animal models for HBV infection, animal models based on a series of HBV-related hepadnaviruses were discovered in the past decades (ducks, geese, herons, woodchucks, squirrels and woolly monkeys) [6]. Among them, the Eastern woodchuck (Marmota monax, M. monax) represents a well established animal model for investigating HBV-related disease and served in preclinical efficacy studies to investigate therapeutic strategies for CHB [7–9]. M. monax is naturally infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), which is genetically closely related to human HBV, and has a disease course similar to that in HBV-infected patients. Recently, we found that Marmota himalayana (M. himalayana), an Asian animal species closely related to M. monax, is susceptible to WHV infection and can be used as a new mammalian model for HBV infection [10]. It is proposed that M. himalayana and M. monax are derived from a common ancestor, and belong to the same subgenera Marmota [11, 12]. Our previous genetic and immunogenetic analysis also indicated that the M. himalayana are closely related to M. monax, as the genes of the immune system of both species are nearly identical in their nucleotide sequences, as analyzed so far [13–15]. However, the transcriptional comparison analysis between the two species was restricted to only a few sequenced gene segments due to the lack of accessible genomic resources for both species. The lack of transcriptional sequence information has also hampered the application of the woodchuck model for functional genomics analysis and immunological mechanism studies in HBV and HCC.In recent years, the use of deep-sequencing technologies has offered a powerful tool for a global and rapid transcriptome analysis via a high-throughput approach [16]. For example, RNA-Seq can generate millions of short cDNA reads from the transcriptome of an organism. The resulting reads are either aligned to a reference genome or reference transcripts, or assembled de novo (without the genomic sequence) to produce a genome-scale transcription map that consists of gene expression profiling, genomics function annotation, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and simple sequence repeats (SSR) marker identification, as well as protein coding sequence (CDS) prediction [17–19].The first woodchuck transcriptome analysis was carried out by S.P.Fletcher et al using deep-sequencing technology (the Roche 454 Genome Sequencer FLX). In the study, the authors briefly described the sequencing, assembly and annotation of the woodchuck transcriptome, and focused on the characterization of the transcriptional response to persistent WHV infection and WHV-induced HCC (S.P.Fletcher et al., Hepatology 2012) [20]. By taking the power of deep-sequencing technologies, the authors were able to establish the translational utility of the woodchuck model and provide new insights into various immune pathways which may play a role in HBV persistence or associated liver diseases. However, the data of basic woodchuck transcriptome analysis of this report, such as CDS information, were still inaccessible. Besides, to our knowledge, there was still no transcriptome information of M. himalayana available so far.In this study, we report and focus on the sequencing, assembly, annotation, and comparison of the transcriptomes of M. monax and M. himalayana by using Illumina RNA-Seq technology. This transcriptomic resource may serve as a valuable foundation for further molecular, developmental and comparative evolutionary studies, as well as for the identification and characterization of functional genes that are involved in WHV infection and HCC development in the woodchuck model.Materials and MethodsAnimalsM. monax were purchased from North Eastern Wildlife (Harrison, ID, USA) and M. himalayana were captured in the area of Tongren county (N35°31′25.42″, E102°01′33.42), Qinghai province, China. The capture of M. himalayana for this study was performed in 2009 and 2010, and no specific permissions for the capture activities were needed in Qinghai province at that time. Each animal was housed in a single cage with two separate chambers. One chamber was for food and drink, and the other one was for living with its floor covered by sterilized hay. The conditions of experimental facility were kept as follows, the room temperature: 25 ± 1°C, the air humidity: 60% ± 10%, the light cycle: 12:12 hours. The animals were euthanized by intracardiac injection of 1ml T-61. Abdomen incision was made to sufficiently expose the abdominal organs of the sacrificed animal, and the sections of spleen and liver were quickly collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, China (Permit Number: 491). All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. The information on age, gender, body weight, duration in the laboratory environment and the date of euthanasia of used animals were provided in S1 Table.RNA Extraction, cDNA Library Synthesis and RNA SequencingTotal RNA was extracted from the liver and spleen samples of two M. monax and four M. himalayana (Table 1). RNA was extracted from frozen tissue samples using Trizol total RNA extraction reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Briefly, 60mg tissue sample was ground with liquid nitrogen into powder and transferred the powder sample into the 2 ml tube containing of 1ml Trizol reagent, and then the total RNA was extracted by protein depletion processing with Chloroform/isoamyl (24:1) alcohol and washing with isopropyl alcohol. At last, the dry RNA was dissolved in 25μL RNase-free water and measuring concentration with NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Inc). RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing was carried out by Beijing Genomics Institute BGI (Hong-Kong, China). In brief, DNase I digestion was performed to remove any traces of genomic DAN and magnetic beads with oligo (dT) were used to isolate mRNA. Following purification, the mRNA was fragmented using divalent cations at elevated temperature. Taking these short fragments as templates, the first-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers and Superscript TM III (Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The second strand cDNA was synthesized using buffer, dNTPs, RNaseH and DNA polymerase I. Short fragments were purified with a QiaQuick PCR extraction kit (Qiagen) and resolved with EB buffer for end reparation and poly(A) addition. The short fragments were then connected using sequencing adapters. The suitable fragments were selected as templates for the PCR amplification. For the quality control steps, Agilent 2100 Bioanaylzer and ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System were used in quantification and qualification of the sample library. The libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq™ 2000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

Summary of transcriptome Illumina sequencing of M. monax and M. himalayana.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165875.t001Filter RNA-Seq raw reads and sequence assemblyRaw reads generated from the RNA-seq were filtered by removing reads with adaptors, reads with unknown nucleotides larger than 5% and low-quality reads which the percentage of low-quality bases (base quality≤10) was more than 20%. The filtered reads were assembled into transcripts using Trinity (version: release-20121005) [21], a reference genome-independent assembler which combines three independent software modules: Inchworm, Chrysalis, and Butterfly. In brief, Inchworm assembled the RNA-seq reads into the unique sequences of transcripts (contigs). Chrysalis clustered the Inchworm contigs and constructed complete de Bruijn graphs for each cluster. Each cluster represented the full transcriptional complexity for a given gene (or sets of genes that share sequences in common). Chrysalis then partitioned the full read set among these disjoint graphs. Butterfly processed the individual graphs in parallel, including tracing the paths that reads and pairs of reads take within the graph, ultimately reporting full-length transcripts for alternatively spliced isoforms, and teasing apart transcripts that corresponds to paralogous genes. The ultimate result sequences of Trinity were called Unigenes. When multiple samples from the same species were sequenced, Unigenes from each sample's assembly were taken into the further process of sequence splicing and redundancy removing with sequence clustering software [22] to acquire non-redundant Unigenes as long as possible.Annotation of UnigenesUnigenes were used for BLAST searches and annotation against an NCBI Nr protein database [23] (NCBI non-redundant sequence database) using an E-value cut-off of 0.00001 (E-value≤ 0.00001). Consensus sequences were further aligned by BLASTX to protein databases such as Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics databases (Swiss-Prot) [24], Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [25] and Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) [26], retrieving proteins with the highest sequence similarity with the given sequences along with the functional annotations for their proteins. If results of different databases conflicted, a priority order of Nr, Swiss-Prot, KEGG and COG was followed. The Blast2GO program [27] (version: release 2012-10-01) was used to obtain Gene Ontology (GO) [28] annotations for the sequences, as well as for KEGG and COG analysis. The WEGO software [29] was then used to perform GO functional classification of all sequences to view the distribution of gene functions of the species at the macro level. The analysis mapped all of the annotated sequences to GO terms in the database and calculated the number of sequences associated with every term.CDS prediction of UnigenesUnigenes were firstly aligned to protein databases and then the sequences with the highest rank in blast results were selected to decide the CDS of Unigenes. For Unigenes that could not be aligned to any database were scanned by ESTScan [30] with software ESTScan (version: v3.0.2) producing nucleotide sequence in (5' − 3') direction and amino sequence of the predicted coding region. The numbers of CDS were summarized, and the length distribution of Unigenes blast and ESTScan CDS were added up.Unigene SNP and SSR analysisThe SNPs were identified on the consensus sequence through the comparison with the Unigenes using software SOAPsnp. The SSR detection was done with software MicroSAtellite (MISA) using Unigenes as reference.Similarity Analysis of GO ClassificationA total number of M. himalayana Unigenes annotated by GO classification were aligned in consistency with M. monax in four range values, compartmentalized by genetic similarity.Results and DiscussionSample preparation and Illumina sequencingTo globally characterize the transcriptome features of the two species of woodchuck, total RNA was isolated from different tissues of five animals: liver samples of M. monax (Mm1) and M. himalayana (Mh3 and Mh4); spleen samples of M. monax (Mm2) and M. himalayana (Mh1 and Mh2) (Table 1). After cleaning and quality checks, six independent rounds of Illumina sequencing for each sample were performed and generated 1,663,766,16 raw reads in total. The raw reads were preprocessed to eliminate primer/adaptor contamination and low quality sections of reads because these sequences can substantially compromise de novo assembly. At last, in total 1,498,715,88 clean reads were generated, encompassing 13,488,422,920 total nucleotides (nt) (Table 1). These data were comprised of high quality reads with the Q20 percentages greater than 96%, hardly any N percentages and nearly half GC percentages for each of the six libraries (Table 1). The raw sequence data sets are available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (accession number: SRP074653 and SRP075170).De novo assembly of sequence reads without a reference genomeTranscriptome de novo assembly was carried out with short reads assembling program-Trinity [31], which combines three independent software modules: Inchworm, Chrysalis, and Butterfly, applied sequentially to process large volumes of RNA-seq reads. Firstly, the RNA-seq data were assembled into the unique sequences of transcripts by Inchworm to generate Contigs for each of the six libraries. Table 2 shows the general information of Contigs, including total number, total length, mean length and N50 Contig length (50% of the total assembled sequence was contained in Contigs of this length or longer). Fig 1 shows the length distribution of Contigs ranging from 200 bp to over 3,000 bp. In all samples, the most abundant Contigs were 200 bp and the least abundant were 3000 bp. Next, we pooled the Contigs of M. monax and M. himalayana respectively. The pooled Contigs were clustered into sets of connected components by Chrysalis. Each cluster represents the full transcriptional complexity for a given gene (or sets of genes that share sequences in common). Complete de Bruijn graphs for each cluster were constructed by Chrysalis. The individual de Bruijn graphs were processed in parallel by Butterfly to reconstruct plausible full-length, linear transcripts. The ultimate result sequences of Trinity were called Unigenes. These Unigenes were then clustered using the TIGR Gene Indices clustering tools (TGICL) to join further sequences and remove any redundant sequences [22]. Finally, 106,496 Unigenes of M. monax and 78,483 Unigenes of M. himalayana were generated respectively (Table 2). Fig 2 shows the length distribution of Unigenes ranging from 200 bp to over 3,000 bp. The most abundant Unigenes of both species were 200 bp (43,680 for M. monax and 31,114 for M. himalayana) and the least abundant were 3000 bp (191 for M. monax and 184 for M. himalayana).

In any one cluster, there were several Unigenes for which similarity between the consensus sequences was more than 70%. The other class comprised the Singletons, for which the prefix Unigene was given. For M. monax, 20,897 Unigenes were grouped into 6,383 different clusters, and 85,599 Unigenes were Singletons. For M. himalayana, 15,125 Unigenes were grouped into 6,882 different clusters, and 63,358 Unigenes were Singletons (Table 2).Annotation and classification of Marmota UnigenesFor annotation, the Unigenes were aligned by Blastx (e-value < 0.00001) with protein databases such as NR, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, COG and GO. The KEGG pathway database records networks of molecular interactions in cells, and variants of them, specific to particular organisms. Pathway-based analysis helped to understand further the biological functions of genes. Pathway information for all annotated sequences was obtained from KEGG pathway annotations. COG is a database where orthologous gene products are classified. The whole database is built on genes encoding proteins from species with complete genome sequences as well as the evolutionary relationships between bacteria, algae and eukaryotes. All Unigenes were aligned to the COG database to predict and classify possible functions. GO offers three ontologies of genes: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. The basic unit of GO is the GO-term which belongs to a type of ontology. Based on the NR annotation, the Blast2GO program was used to get the GO annotation of all Unigenes. WEGO software was then used for GO functional classification and to understand the distribution of gene functions of the species at a macro level. In each database, two criteria were used, the score and the e-value. Each gene was analyzed independently, and the annotation was made according to these criteria. As a result, 41,301, 72,951, 39,499, 29,156, 11,894, 31,314 Unigenes for M. monax and 33,957, 58,403, 32,318, 24,258, 10,040, 26,163 Unigenes for M. himalayana were annotated using the NR, NT, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, COG, GO databases, respectively. In total, 73,603 and 58,893 annotated sequences were identified for M. monax and M. himalayana, respectively (Table 3).

Among the annotated sequences, the species with the highest number of best hits was Saimiri boliviensis (8.7% matched genes of M. monax and 8.9% of M. himalayana), followed by Homo sapiens (7.9% of M. monax and M. himalayana) and Otolemur garnettii (6.2% of M. monax and 6.6% of M. himalayana) (Fig 3B).

Similar category distribution of Unigenes was observed between M. monax and M. himalayana. Results showed a high proportion of genes from the categories of: “biologic regulation”, “cellular process”, “metabolic process”, “cell”, “cell part”, “organelle”, “binding” and “catalytic” with only a few genes related to “cell killing”, “extracellular matrix part”, “nucleoid”, “channel regulator activity”, “antioxidant activity”, “receptor regulator activity” and “translation regulator activity”. No Unigenes were clustered as “carbon utilization”, “virion”, “virion part”, “chemoattractant activity”, “chemorepellent activity”, “merallochapter activity” or “protein tag”(Fig 4).

A high similarity of the distribution pattern of GOC function classification between M. monax and M. himalayana was observed. The category with the most number of Unigenes classified is “general function prediction” (4576 for M. monax and 3870 for M. himalayana), followed by “translation, ribosomal structure” (2671 for M. monax and 2190 for M. himalayana) and “replication, combination and repair” (2351 for M. monax and 1904 for M. himalayana). “Nuclear structure” represents the smallest category for both species (4 for M. monax and 5 for M. himalayana) (Fig 5).

A Total of 29,156 and 24,258 transcripts were mapped in M. monax and M. himalayana respectively, and 258 pathways were predicted for both species. The data from KEGG annotation demonstrated that the largest predicted category was metabolic pathway (11.5% for M. monax and 10.7% for M.himalayana), which contained 3,347 and 2,591 transcripts for M. monax and M. himalayana respectively, and the second largest category was focal adhesion (4.2% and 4.3%). Other pathways predicted in Marmota included the following: pathway in cancer (3.7% and 3.9%); regulation of action cytoskeleton (4.0% and 3.9%); amoebiasis (3.4% and 3.0%); endocytosis (2.9% and 2.8%); MAPK signal pathway (2.8% and 2.7%); and HTLV-I infection (3.3% and 2.9%), et al (S4 Table).The results of annotation of transcriptome provide a comprehensive fundamental functional classification and pathway identification for the two Marmota breeds, and will be a valuable resource for future researches involving metabolic processes and pathway function in the Marmota animal models.Protein Coding Region PredictionNext, the Unigenes were aligned by blastx (evalue<0.00001) to protein databases to predict their coding DNA sequences (CDS) in the priority order of NR, Swiss-Prot, KEGG and COG. Proteins with highest ranks in blast results were taken to decide the CDS of Unigenes, which were then translated into amino acid sequences with the standard codon table. The orientation and CDS of Unigenes that had no hit in blast were predicted using ESTScan. In total, 41,247 CDS (S1 and S2 Files) of M. monax and 34,033 CDS (S3 and S4 Files) of M. himalayana were obtained by blastx and ESTScan (Table 4). Fig 6 shows the length distribution of CDS by blastx of both woodchuck species ranging from 200 bp to over 3,000 bp, and the most abundant CDS were 300 bp and the least abundant were 3000 bp. The most abundant CDS predicted by ESTscan were also 300 bp in length for both species (Fig 7). Detailed CDS information is available in S1, S2, S3 and S4 Files.

To identify the SSR for M. monax and M. himalayana, software MicroSAtellite (MISA) was utilized by using Unigenes as reference. In total, 14,392 SSRs for M. monax and 12,983 for M. himalayana have been identified. The mononucleotide SSRs accounted for the largest amounts of identified SSRs (8,501 for M. monax and 8,073 for M. himalayana), followed by dinucleotide (3128 and 2451), tetra-nucleotide (2,052 and 1,855), quad-nucleotide (369 and 312), penta-nucleotide (245 and 212) and the smallest amounts of hexanucleotide (97 and 80) (Fig 8). These SSRs will be useful as molecular markers for assaying the functional diversity in natural populations or germplasm collections.

SNP can be used to follow the inheritance patterns of chromosomal regions from generation to generation and are powerful tools in the study of genetic factors associated with diseases [34]. Here, the software SOAPsnp was utilized to identify the SNPs of all individual animals. In brief, the consensus sequences for the genome of each individual animal were assembled based on the alignment of the raw sequencing reads with the Unigenes of M. monax or M. himalayana. The SNPs were then identified on the consensus sequences by using the corresponding species Unigenes as references. Table 5 shows the numbers of different types of SNPs identified for all six animals used in this study. In all animals, the most frequent SNPs are A-G transition and the least are A-T transversion.

When using the Unigenes of M. monax as the reference sequences, more than 74% (7,757) M. himalayana Unigenes with identical annotation showed a homology of 90–100%. This is followed by 9.9% (1,037) M. himalayana Unigenes with a homology of 80–90% to corresponding M. monax Unigenes. The M. himalayana Unigenes with a homology of 60–70% is about 7.67% (800) (Fig 9A). GO functional classification was also performed to further analyze the homology distribution of the Unigenes in different functional categories. The Unigenes in category of biological process showed the highest similarity in sequences between the two Marmota species. In all 57 functional classifications, only the Unigenes of extracellular matrix part, nucleoid, receptor regulator activity and translation regulator activity showed relatively lower homology (Fig 9B). Thus, these results indicated that M. himalayana shares a high similarity in transcriptome sequences with M. monax.

In this study, we successfully performed Illumina RNA-Seq technology to sequence the transcriptome of liver and spleen samples of M. monax and M. himalayana. Consensus sequences and Unigenes were generated by de novo assembly and functional annotation for both species. The Unigenes were aligned by blastx to protein databases to obtain the CDS information. The SNPs and SSRs were also analyzed for all Unigenes obtained. Moreover, a large-scale transcriptome comparison was performed and revealed a high similarity in transcriptome sequences between the two marmota species. This is the first time that the transcriptome of M. himalayana was fully sequenced and analyzed. Our study provides an extensive amount of novel sequence information for M. monax and M. himalayana. This information may serve as a valuable genomics resource for further molecular, developmental and comparative evolutionary studies, as well as for the identification and characterization of functional genes that are involved in WHV infection and HCC development in the woodchuck model.Supporting InformationS1 File.

Euchromatin is accessible to the transcription machinery whereas heterochromatin is more compact and associated with transcriptional repression [1]. Multiple factors including transcription factors, post-translational histone modifications and DNA methylation are thought to maintain heterochromatin repression [2]. Among them, histone hypoacetylation, histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1α) were shown to be required for maintenance of heterochromatin [3, 4]. Constitutive heterochromatin predominantly consists of satellite repeats. In mouse cells, pericentromeric and centromeric satellite repeats are the major and minor satellite repeats respectively [5]. Heterochromatinisation of pericentromeric repeats is important for centromere formation and maintenance of genome stability [6]. Low levels of pericentromeric satellite repeat transcription have been detected under various physiological conditions, including cell cycle, senescence, development and differentiation [7–10]. However, aberrant overexpression of pericentromeric satellite repeats has been detected in several pathological conditions, including cellular stress [11–13], cancer [14–17] and some genetic disorders [18–20].The proteasome is a highly conserved proteolytic complex comprised of the catalytic 20S core particle (CP) capped at one or both ends by the 19s regulatory particle (RP). It regulates protein quality by recognising, unfolding and degrading polyubiquitin tagged, aged, misfolded or damaged proteins [21–23]. Growing evidence, mainly from studies in yeast, suggests that the proteasome is associated with chromatin and regulates transcription [24–30]. Thus, the proteasome regulates the levels and binding of activators as well as recruitment of co-activators at 5’ regulatory regions, thereby controlling transcriptional initiation [26, 31, 32] as well as elongation [27, 33]. It is also thought to enable release of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and thereby regulate transcription termination [34]. Moreover, defects of the proteasome subunits in yeast were shown to enhance transcriptional repression of heterochromatin [35]. Additionally, ubiquitin mediated degradation of the Jmj family protein Epe1 was shown to be required for the accurate formation of heterochromatin boundaries [36]. Notably, few studies, mostly in mammalian cells, suggest that the proteasome also regulates transcriptional repression. For example, inhibition of the 20S proteasome resulted in increased levels of RNAPII and the active chromatin mark H3K4me3 at the glucocorticoid responsive gene promoter, where proteasome binding was identified in human cells [37]. Another study proposed that the proteasome blocks nonspecific transcription initiation by preventing formation of the preinitiation complex at cryptic transcription sites [38] and degrades RNAPII or a member of the pre-initiation complex that drives the transcription at these ectopic sites, thereby suppressing transcription. Moreover, a study performed on rat liver showed that proteasome inhibition led to global histone hypomethylation (especially at H3K9 and H3K27 residues) and hyperacetylation [39]. Here we demonstrate that proteasomal activity in mice is also involved in the repression of pericentromeric satellite repeat expression and integrity of pericentromeric clusters.Results and DiscussionBinding of the 20S proteasome at major satellite repeatsSeveral studies have shown the presence of the proteasome in eukaryotic nuclei [40–44] and its recruitment to chromatin including centromeres [45], telomeres [46] and sites of cryptic transcriptional initiation [38]. To investigate whether the proteasome might participate in transcriptional silencing of heterochromatin, proteasome binding at pericentromeric and several other endogenous repeats was analysed using ChIP-seq data previously obtained in mouse 3T3-L1 cells [47]. The results indicated a ~1.2 fold enrichment of the proteasome at pericentromeric major satellite repeats and LINE L1 elements and ~1.9 fold enrichment at centromeric minor satellite repeats, compared to input, whereas all other elements showed no signal above input (Fig 1A). To replicate this qualitative observation, ChIP was performed in another mouse NIH3T3 cell line using an antibody against the 20S proteasome which confirmed binding of the 20S proteasome to major satellite repeats as well as to LINE L1 elements (Fig 1B). The signal from minor satellite was relatively low and close to background, as was the case for the ChIP-seq data, making it difficult to be precise about the extent of enrichment in this location.

A dose-dependent increase in transcript level of major satellite repeat was observed upon MG132 treatment, reaching 10-fold in treated cells when compared to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO—vehicle) (Fig 2A), whereas no effect was seen on the minor satellite expression (Fig 2A). The increase in the major satellite transcript levels could be due to an increase in transcription or to inhibition of major satellite transcript degradation. To assess whether transcription was required for the increase in major satellite repeats transcripts, cells were treated with the transcriptional inhibitor Actinomycin D (ActD) concomitant with MG132. Transcription was effectively inhibited (Fig 2B) and the increase of the major satellite repeat transcription upon proteasome inhibition was blocked in cells treated concomitantly with both MG132 and ActD (Fig 2B), indicating that their upregulation in response to MG132 was indeed transcription dependent. This was further validated at the single cell level using RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (RNA FISH) targeting major satellite transcripts. Proteasome inhibition led to an increase in the major satellite repeat expression in MG132 treated cells for 4h (Fig 2C). Major satellite signal was located surrounding or within a proportion of DAPI-dense heterochromatin regions showing the characteristic morphology of chromocentres [48]. Signal was also identified in areas of the nucleus lacking chromocentres suggesting either partial transcription from intergenic major satellite DNA sequences or migration of the transcript away from the chromocentres (Fig 2C). Thus, the RNA-FISH analysis is consistent with the previous observation that major satellite repeat transcription was upregulated upon proteasome inhibition (Fig 2A and 2B).

To confirm the cell-cycle dependent transcription of major and minor satellite repeats, counterflow centrifugal elutriation [54] was performed for cell synchronization. Elutriation offers the advantage of selection of cells in different stages of cell cycle and, unlike chemical agents, does not affect the metabolism of cells [54]. The expression of major and minor satellite repeats peaked in G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle respectively (S1 Fig), consistent with previous published studies (Ferri et al., 2009; Lu and Gilbert, 2007). We next investigated the effect of proteasome inhibition on (i) the kinetics of transcriptional activation of major and minor satellite repeats and (ii) the cell cycle. Interestingly, the kinetic analysis showed an upregulation of the major satellite repeat expression already at 4h after MG132 treatment (Fig 3A), the time point where no significant effect was seen on the cell cycle profile (Fig 3B). As previously, minor satellite repeat expression was unaffected (Fig 3A). Taken together, these results suggest that upregulation of major satellite repeat expression upon proteasome inhibition is unlikely to be a consequence of cell cycle skewing because the upregulation of the major satellite repeat expression occurred without any significant effects on the cell cycle distribution.

Error bars = SEM of at least 10 biological replicates. Proteasome inhibition upregulated the major satellite repeat expression at 4h of treatment, while minor satellite remained unaffected. (B) Treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 4h does not significantly alter the distribution of the cell cycle profile.

H3K9me3, which is considered a “hallmark” of heterochromatin [55] was found to be unaffected by MG132 treatment (Fig 4A). This was further confirmed by immunofluorescence (IF) (Fig 4B). Similar to H3K9me3, the levels of H3 acetylation, H3K4me3 (which is normally associated with promoters of actively transcribed genes [56, 57]) and H3K36me3 (which is normally associated with elongating RNAPII [58, 59]) were found to be similar between cells treated with MG132 and untreated (DMSO) cells (Fig 4A). Thus, the ChIP-qPCR results suggest that proteasome inhibition does not have any net effect on these histone modifications at the major satellite repeat locus. The lack of effect might seem surprising given that proteasome inhibition led to significantly increased transcription of the repeats. This may relate to the proportion of repeat sequences that have been activated by inhibiting the proteasome. The RNA FISH experiment indicates that the number of repeats or heterochromatic clusters that are transcriptionally activated might be a small proportion of the total and therefore any chromatin change would be diluted by the majority of DNA sequences which are not expressing the transcript. This lack of effect on H3K9me3 has been observed in several previous studies (Mosch et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011 and see discussion below) where major satellite repeats were found to be upregulated to a similar degree. In contrast, in Pax3/Pax9 deficient iMEFs [60] there was a more significant increase in major satellite transcription and a clear loss of H3K9me3. Lastly, Zhang et al, have similarly reported that transcriptional activation of silent heterochromatin in yeast can occur without any significant changes in the histone modifications [61]. Heterochromatin at pericentromeres is not only regulated by histone modification but also by structural proteins such as HP1α which are involved in chromatin condensation and maintenance of stable heterochromatin [62, 63]. Therefore, the effect of proteasome inhibition on the localisation and distribution of HP1α was evaluated by IF after treatment of NIH3T3 cells with proteasome inhibitor. As expected, in the untreated cells (DMSO), HP1α was concentrated in the DAPI dense stained regions, confirming its localisation to pericentromeric heterochromatin. Interestingly, MG132 treatment resulted in a dispersed distribution of the HP1α protein throughout the nucleus, (Fig 4C and S2A Fig) however, total HP1α levels remained similar between treated and untreated cells (S2B Fig). Thus, proteasome inhibition led to displacement of HP1α from chromocentres, without visible changes in the DAPI dense staining domains. Whether HP1α is displaced specifically from pericentromeric heterochromatin (or from other repressed genomic loci that are associated with chromocentres) remains to be shown. Furthermore this observation is consistent with previous studies where loss of HP1 from pericentromeric heterochromatin was not sufficient to disrupt the DAPI dense stained regions or H3K9me3 [64, 65]. It is also in line with previous reports [64, 66], where transcriptional activation of pericentromeric repeats was accompanied by either partial or full displacement of HP1 from pericentromeres without any changes in H3K9me3 levels, the latter of which serves as a platform for HP1 recruitment to chromatin [67, 68]. Also, HP1α/β double knockout in MEF cells led to upregulation of major satellite repeat expression without affecting the localization of H3K9me3 [64]. Another example comes from BRCA1-deficient cells, where a significant reduction in the number of HP1 positive foci and loss of ubiquitylation of histone H2A (H2Aub) was reported to result in activation of major and minor satellite repeat transcription [66]. Lastly, mutation of variant H3.3 at an early stage in development resulted in increased accumulation of major satellite repeat transcripts which was accompanied by displacement of HP1 from chromocentres [69]. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that dissociation of HP1α, as seen here, could be sufficient for the remodelling of heterochromatin rendering it accessible to the transcriptional machinery.

HP1α delocalises from chromocentres upon proteasome inhibition whereas the histone modifications remain unaffected.(A) Proteasome inhibition does not affect canonical histone modifications on major and minor satellite repeats. NIH3T3 cells were treated with 20μM MG132 for 4h followed by ChIP–qPCR analysis using antibodies against repressive mark H3K9me3 and activating marks H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and H3ac. Data is shown as relative enrichment to H3 with background subtraction. The y-axis scale was adjusted depending on the signal obtained with different antibodies.

Scale bar 10μm.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165873.g004The immunofluorescence imaging of chromocentres (visualised by DAPI) after treatment with proteasome inhibitor did not reveal any obvious structural changes (Fig 4C). Considering that (i) major satellite repeats reside at these regions and (ii) a previous study suggested that upregulation of major satellite repeat expression was accompanied by a marked decrease in the number of chromocentres [66], here the number of chromocentres was analysed in NIH3T3 cells after proteasome inhibition. To acquire cells in a high-throughput manner, an imaging flow cytometer (ImageStream X) was used. Cells were treated with either DMSO or MG132, followed by staining with DRAQ5, which is less toxic for living cells compared to DAPI [70]. Treatment of cells with MG132 resulted in a shift of the distribution of the number of chromocentres per cell towards the right (Fig 5), which increased with time. It is possible that the increased number of chromocentres per cell after proteasome inhibition might result from eviction of HP1α and destabilisation of chromocentre structure, which in turn could reduce the compaction of heterochromatin and increase accessibility of the transcriptional machinery to the underlying DNA sequences.

Here we showed the binding of proteasome to major satellite repeats and their dysregulation upon proteasome inhibition by MG132. As the proteasome participates in a large number of cellular pathways and controls the steady-state level of many proteins, it is difficult to distinguish between direct involvement of the proteasome on the transcription of the pericentromeric repeat and indirect effects mediated by a protein whose level is controlled by proteasome activity. Several studies have shown that the proteasome degrades stalled RNAPII during transcription-coupled repair [71, 72] and a similar mechanism could potentially operate at major satellite repeats. At pericentromeric repeats the proteasome might function to degrade RNAPII and thereby prevent their expression. Additionally, accumulation of misfolded proteins due to proteasome inhibition is known to trigger cell stress responses [73–80]. Therefore, a component from the cell stress pathway might also be responsible for the de-repression of the major satellite repeat. For example, HSF1 was previously shown to activate the transcription of pericentromeric Satellite II and III repeats in human cells upon heat shock in order to form nuclear stress bodies [13, 81, 82]; this effect was reported to be human-specific (Valgardsdottir et al., 2008), but similar factors may play a role in other mammals. It is interesting that the eviction of HP1 and disaggregation of chromocentres shown here precedes the detection of major satellite transcripts suggesting that the proteasome is required for integrity of heterochromatin.Materials and MethodsCell lineNIH3T3 cell line was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with L-glutamine (PAA laboratories GmbH) supplemented with Foetal bovine serum (Sigma) (10% v/v), Penicillin/Streptomycin (GIBCO®) (1% v/v) and GlutamixTM-I 100x (GIBCO®) (1% v/v) at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cells were treated with MG132 (Sigma) which was dissolved in DMSO; ActD (Sigma) which was dissolved in DMSO.Quantitative Reverse Transcription Coupled to PCRAfter RNA isolation using TRIZOL® Reagent (Invitrogen) and genomic DNA digestion with a DNA free kit (Ambion), cDNA was synthesized using ThermoScript kit (Invitrogen) and random hexamers following the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantitative PCR was performed using the SYBR® Green Jumpstart™ Taq ReadyMix™ (Sigma-Aldrich®) or SensiMix™ (Bioline) in a Chromo4 DNA engine (MRJ) with Opticon Monitor 3 (BioRad) software. A list of primers used throughout this study is shown in S1 Table.Flow Cytometric AnalysisCells were fixed in ice cold 70% ethanol by incubation overnight at -20°C. Next day, the fixed cells were washed three time in PBS and treated with 0.2μg/μl RNAse A (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 20min at 37°C. Cells were washed again in PBS and cellular DNA was stained with 50mg/ml propidium iodide (Millipore) diluted in PBS. Stained cells were quantified by FACS (BD LSRII) and gated according to single-cell population and to DNA content representative of the cell cycle.Cell cycle separation by counterflow centrifugal elutriationCell cycle separation was conducted using an elutriation system with JE-5.0 elutriator rotor (Beckmann Coulter Inc) equipped with Avanti J-26 XP centrifuge (Beckmann Coulter Inc) and a pump. 2X10^8 cells were harvested and washed twice with Elutriation buffer (3.4mM EDTA and 1% FBS in 1X PBS). In order to obtain a single cell suspension the cell pellet was resuspended in 40ml Elutriation buffer and passed twice through an 18-gauge needle (25G) syringe. Next, the sample was loaded into the pre-assembled elutriation chamber. Throughout the elutriation process the centrifuge was maintained at a constant speed of 1700rpm at 4°C. To obtain elutriation fractions, the flow rate of the elutriation buffer was increased from 8ml/min to 20ml/min by 1ml/min increments. Consecutively 200ml effluent volumes were collected from the centrifuge for each flow rate and cells were pelleted by centrifugation. To assess the quality of synchronization in each elutriated fractions, cells were stained PI followed by FACS analysis. Based on the cell cycle profile similarity, elutriation fractions were further grouped and categorised into 3 different fractions.Chromatin immunoprecipitationChIP experiments were performed as described previously [83], with few modifications. Briefly, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37°C. Crosslinking was quenched by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125mM for 5min at room temperature. Cell monolayers were incubated in cold swelling buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10mM KCl, 2.5% NP-40. Adjust pH to 7.9. Add freshly 0.5μl P8430 Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and 5μl 0.1M PMSF in isopropanal per 1 ml of Swelling buffer) followed by scraping and lysing using a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in cold sonication buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 140 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS. Adjust pH to 7.9. Add freshly 0.5μl P8430 Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and 5μl 0.1M PMSF in isopropanol per 1 ml of Sonication buffer) and sonicated using Biorupter (Diagenode) with high energy. Sheared chromatin was centrifuged twice at 15000g for 15min and the supernatant was used for the immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed by initially sonicating (low energy) the chromatin with antibody or no antibody (negative control) using Biorupter (Diagenode) following an overnight incubation with Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) on a rotating wheel at 4°C. Next day, protein G Dynabeads bound to antibody–chromatin complexed was washed and DNA was purified with iPure Kit (Diagenode) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Antibodies used for ChIP were: H3 (Abcam, Ab1791), H3K9me3 (Millipore, 17–625) H3ac (Abcam, Ab47915), H3K4me3 (Abcam, Ab8580), H3K36me3 (Abcam, Ab9050), 20S β6 proteasome (Enzo Life, BML-PW9000).For the ChiP-seq analysis, the repeat element annotations for the mouse GRCm38 genome build were downloaded from the RepeatMasker track from the UCSC genome browser web site. GSM841627 and GSM1095381 sequencing reads (Catic et al., 2013) were aligned to repeat genomes of several different repeat families using Bowtie 2 (v2.2.6; default parameters), and hits were counted whereby multiple matches of a sequence are possible. The repeat genomes were constructed by concatenating the sequences of each instance of the repeat into a single repeat genome for that repeat family where individual repeats were separated by NNNNN to prevent sequences from mapping over instance boundaries.The minor satellite consensus sequence:TTGTAGAACAGTGTATATCAATGAGTTACAATGAGAAACATGGAAAATGATAAAAACCACACTGTAGAACATATTAGATGAGTGAGTTACACTGAAAAACACATTCGTTGGAAACGGGAT, was added manually to the Minor Satellite repeat genome.RNA-FISHRNA in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) was performed using ViewRNA™ ISH Cell Assay kit (Affymetrix, eBioscience) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The images were acquired with a 63X oil-immersion lens using a Leica Microsystems SP5 confocal microscope. Analysis of images was performed by Fiji Image J software. RNA probe: Major satellite RNA probe set was designed and produced by eBioscience (Affymetrix) probe developers. This probe was V00846 —Mouse Satellite DNA sequence—type 1.ImmunofluorescenceCells were fixed with 4% PFA diluted in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X100 for 15 min at room temperature followed by three washes with PBS and permeabilisation with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X100 diluted in PBS for 30min at room temperature. Cells were washed again three times in PBS and incubated in 20mM glycine dissolved in PBS for 30min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were blocked for 1h with PBS+ (1%BSA, 0.1% Casein, 0.02% Fish Skin Gelatin in 1X PBS. pH7.8–8) and incubated with primary antibody appropriately diluted in PBS+ in a dark humidified chamber overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed again three times with PBS and incubated in fluorochrome-conjugated (Alexa488 or Alexa568) secondary antibody diluted to the required concentration in PBS for 1h at RT in a dark humidified chamber. Cells were further washed nine times with PBS and incubated for 15min with DAPI diluted in 1:1000 in PBS at room temperature before mounting them using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired with Leica Microsystems SP5 confocal microscope. Analysis of images was performed by Fiji Image J software. Antibodies used for immunofluorescence were: HP1α (Millipore, 05689), H3K9me3 (Millipore, 17–625)ImagestreamX0.5 million NIH3T3 cells were pelleted and washed twice in cold PBS++ (PBS containing 1mM EDTA and 0.02% (w/v) Sodium azide) and resuspended in 100μl of 1μM DRAQ5 dissolved in PBS++. 20000 events were collected at 40X magnification in bright field and the 658nm laser wavelength with ImageStreamX (Amnis, Seattle, Washington). Raw data was quantitated using the associated Image analysis software (IDEAS Amnis). After single cell and DRAQ5 fluorescence gating, the number of chromosome clusters per cell was determined by computing the intensity of localized Draq5 bright spots within the image that were greater than 2.75 pixels in radius.Western blotCells were lysed using RIPA buffer (50mM Tris pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS. Freshly were added 0.5μl P8430 Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and 5μl 0.1M PMSF in isopropanol per 1 ml of RIFA buffer) and cell extract was cleared by centrifugation at 12 000g for 15min. The supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was determined by Bradford dye colorimetric assay (Bio-rad), following the manufacturer’s instructions. For protein denaturation, lysate samples with specific amounts of protein were mixed with 6X Laemmli buffer (Alfa Aesar) followed by incubation at 100°C for 10min. 5μg of protein was loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel and when electrophoresis was completed, the proteins were electro-transferred from SDS-PAGE gel to pre-washed PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare) in the presence of Transfer buffer (25mM Tris pH 8.3, 190mM glycine. Add freshly 20% (v/v) methanol). The membrane was blocked in blocking buffer (0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 5% non-fat milk in PBS) for 1h at room temperature followed by incubation with the primary antibody in blocking buffer on a rocking platform overnight at 4°C. After washing the membrane in PBS supplemented with 1% Tween, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) in blocking buffer for 1h at room temperature. The presence of HRP on the membrane was then detected using ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare) using the manufacturer’s instructions.Primary antibodies used were: HP1α (Millipore, MAB3446) was used at 1:500; α-tubulin (Sigma, T5168) at 1:10000. Secondary HRP-goat anti mouse antibody (Life Technologies, G21040) was used at 1:20000.Supporting InformationS1 Fig. Transcription of major satellite peaks in G1 phase and minor satellite in G2/M phase of the cell cycle.(A) Cell fractions enriched at specific phases of the cell cycle, were obtained by centrifugal elutriation.

Silkworm is particularly susceptible to the B. mori nucleopolyhedrosis virus (BmNPV), which is one of the major pathogens that remain a big challenge to the sericulture industry. BmNPV is a circular double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus and belongs to the family Baculoviridae [1]. DNA replication and gene expression in this virus follow a cascade reaction pattern with successful infection depending on stage specific expression of BmNPV genes [2]. BmNPV infection causes high larval mortality and significantly damages to silk production [3,4].MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 18–25 nucleotides (nts) small non-coding RNAs processed from the stem-loop precursor termed as the pre-miRNA. Growing evidence reveals that miRNAs are key players in regulating immunity and host-pathogen interactions [5–8]. Several studies have reported changes in the expression profile of host cellular miRNAs after a viral infection [9–12]. Previous studies on BmNPV investigated how virus-encoded miRNA regulates BmNPV replication by interacting with BmNPV genes [13–14]. Thus far, only four miRNAs have been reported to target the BmNPV ORFs encoding cathepsin, chitinase, DNA binding protein and vp80 [15]. Recent emerging studies reveal that not only viral miRNAs but also the host cellular miRNAs play critical roles in viral infection. For example, bmo-miR-278-3p positively regulates the mRNA expression of B. mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (BmCPV) by interacting with IBP2 (Insulin-related peptide binding protein 2) in silkworm larvae [16]. Similarly, Hz-miR-24 regulates DdRP (DNA dependent RNA polymerase) expression in Heliothis virescens AV (HvAV-3e) [17]. Besides, Bmo-miR-8 was identified as an anti-viral miRNA, which is suppressed by BmNPV following infection or transfection of abmnpv-miR-1 into the host cell [13]. MiR-32 inhibits the accumulation of primate foamy virus type 1[18]. Thus, the expression level of host miRNAs may be induced or inhibited after viral infection and may help their replication by targeting viral or host genes.In this study, we focused on the host cellular miRNAs at the genome-wide level, which revealed 38 differentially expressed silkworm miRNAs involved in BmNPV infection based on deep sequencing. Among these, 9 miRNAs were validated to be differentially expressed using the stem-loop qRT-PCR. We found that bmo-miR-277-5p targeted the B. mori DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferase (Dnmt2) as shown by dual-luciferase reporter assay. These results may provide new clue to explore interaction between silkworm and BmNPV.Materials and MethodsSilkworm strain and virus inoculationThe P50 silkworm strain was reared at room temperature and under a photoperiod of 12h light and 12h dark until the fourth molt. For viral inoculation, BmNPV viral stock was suspended in distilled water at a concentration of 109 polyhedra/ml. Mulberry leaves treated with BmNPV were fed to 20 newly exuviated fourth instar larvae. The dose of infection was about 1 × 106 polyhedra per larva. The control un-infected larvae were fed on mulberry leaves treated with 0.9% NaC1 solution.RNA isolationEach of ten BmNPV-infected and un-infected control larvae were collected to extract RNA using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Following quality inspection, the total RNAs were stored in -80°C for further experiments.Small RNA library construction, Solexa sequencing and data analysisTwo small RNA libraries were prepared from un-infected silkworm larvae and those infected with BmNPV 72h post-infection. Each library pooled equal amount of total RNA from 10 infected or un-infected larvae. Small RNA library construction and Solexa sequencing were performed by CapitalBio Corporation (Beijing, China). The detailed workflow and data analysis were as described in our previous study [19]. The screened unique reads were mapped onto miRBASE (Release 21.0) (http://www.mirbase.org/), and perfectly matched sequences were defined as known miRNAs.Prediction of novel miRNAsLow abundance reads (counts < 2) and non-coding RNA including rRNA, tRNA and snoRNA were removed to identify novel miRNAs. The candidate unique reads were searched against the SilkDB (http://silkworm.genomics.org.cn/). Secondary structure was analyzed using Einverted of Emboss [20] and RNA fold program [21] based on extracted 150 nts upstream and downstream of candidate unique reads.Prediction of target genes and Gene ontology analysisThree popular target-predicting software, PITA, Targetscan and miRanda [22–24] were used to predict potential target genes by aligning candidate miRNAs against 3’-UTR sequences, which were extracted from the downstream 1000 nt of silkworm mRNA CDS. Automatic GO analysis of Molecule Annotation System (MAS3.0) was used to analyze the function of predict target genes for the differentially expressed miRNA in BmNPV infected larvae.RT-PCR analysisA total of 1μg RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20μl reaction system using the Prime Script™ RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa). Reverse transcript products were generated using specific stem-loop primers designed based on the method described by Chen [25] under the following condition: denaturation for 2 min at 94°C, 30 cycles of 94°C for 40 s, 58°C for 40 s and 72°C for 40 s, and then 72°C for 5 min. The B. mori U6 snRNA gene was amplified as a positive control. The PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel.Differentially expressed miRNAsThe miRNA count was normalized to TPM (number of transcripts per million clean tags) to compensate for variable numbers of tags generated for each sample. MiRNAs with a P value < = 0.05 and log2FC>1 or log2FC<-1 were identified as significantly differentially expressed in BmNPV infected larvae compared to un-infected larvae.Quantitative real-time PCRReal-time PCR reactions were carried out on an ABI 7300 machine (Applied Biosystems, USA) and performed in a 20 μl reaction volume according to the manufacturer's instructions in the SYBR Premix Ex Taq™ kit (Takara, China) with thermal cycling parameters at 95°C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, and 60°C for 31 s. Following amplification, melting curves were constructed. The silkworm U6 snRNA were used as a reference gene for normalization respectively. Three biological replicates with three technical replicates were analyzed. A relative quantitative method (2-△△Ct) was used to assess differences in gene expression levels. Primer sequences used are shown in S4 Table.Dual-luciferase reporter assayBombyx mori Dnmt2 3’UTR containing the potential target-binding sequences for miR-277-5p and mutated Dnmt2 3’UTR were synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China). Dnmt2 3’UTR as well as mutated 3’UTR were cloned into the PUC57 vector and verified by sequencing. Correct Dnmt2 3’UTR and mutated 3’UTR were cloned downstream of firefly luciferase in the PmirGLO vector (Promega) using NheI and SalI restriction sites to create PmirGLO-Dnmt2 and PmirGLO-Dnmt2-mut constructs. MiR-277-5p mimics and negative controls synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China) with PmirGLO, PmirGLO-Dnmt2 and PmirGLO-Dnmt2-mut constructs were co-transfected into 293 cells using lipofectamine2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 48h after transfection and analyzed for Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase. Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate.ResultsConfirmation of BmNPV infectionUnder the dose of 1× 106 polyhedra per larva, all the infected silkworm larvae showed typical symptom with tense and milk white body wall. Some larvae appeared bamboo-like structure due to the apophysis of intersegmental membrane. BmNPV infection were further validated with appearance of a lot of polyhedra under microscope.Overview of two sequenced small RNA librariesTwo small RNA libraries from BmNPV infected and un-infected control silkworm larvae were constructed and sequenced using Solexa sequencing. The sequencing data for the two libraries have deposited in the NCBI Small Reads Archive (SRA) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) under accession number SRP083131. Parameters of the raw reads including adapter sequences, low quality reads, etc. are shown in S1 Table. A total of 6898880 and 6810268 clean reads (size > 18 nt) were obtained from each small library (Table 1). All identical sequence reads in each small library were grouped and converted into unique reads, which were subsequently mapped onto the silkworm genome using Bowtie. As a result, 620899 and 789310 unique reads were collected from infected and un-infected libraries, respectively (Table 1). More than 40% of the unique reads perfectly matched the silkworm genome. Size distributions of total abundances and unique reads were evaluated and are shown in Fig 1. More than 50% of the small RNAs were 18–23 bp in length with the 20 bp RNAs representing the major length class.

Classification of sequenced reads from silkworm.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165865.t001Identification of known and novel silkworm miRNAsTo identify known miRNAs in silkworm, we aligned perfectly mapped unique reads against the silkworm microRNA precursor in the Sanger miRBase (Release 21.0) [26] and obtained 373 known miRNAs. Further, after removing the non-coding RNA (rRNA, tRNA and snoRNA, etc.), multi-mapped reads (>20) and low abundance reads (counts <2), we predicted the secondary structures of the remaining unique reads, which did not find a perfect match in the miRBase (Release 21.0). Those unique reads with a predicted secondary structure were considered as novel miRNAs, among which, those having the same seed sequences with known miRNAs of other species were grouped into conserved miRNAs. As a result, a total of 73 novel miRNAs including 37 conserved miRNAs were identified (Table 2). The details of known and novel miRNAs are shown in S2 and S3 Tables. To validate the newly predicted miRNAs, six novel miRNAs were randomly selected for analysis by stem-loop RT-PCR. Primers used in this experiment are listed in S4 Table. All 6 miRNAs were found to be expressed in the silkworm samples analyzed (Fig 2).

Validation of novel silkworm miRNAs.1μg total RNA extracted from silkworm larvae was reverse transcribed into cDNA after DNase I treatment. Specific stem-loop primers for 6 novel miRNA were used to perform RT-PCR. The PCR products were separated on agarose gel to detect the expression of novel miRNA. The band sizes were about 70-80bp in length. U6,the B. mori U6 snRNA gene was as a positive control.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165865.g002          Download:                            PPT                                PowerPoint slide                                PNG                                larger image                                  ()                                  TIFF                                original image                                  ()                Table 2.

This analysis resulted in a total of 38 differentially expressed miRNAs (Fig 3A). Among these, 31 are known miRNAs and 7 are novel miRNAs. A total of 23 up-regulated and 15 down-regulated miRNAs were detected (Table 3). Further analysis revealed that 7 miRNAs including bmo-miR-3338-3p, bmo-miR-3327-3p, bmo-miR-2856-3p, bmo-miR-iab-8, bmo-miR-2828, novel-25022 and novel-7977 were specially expressed in larvae 72h post-BmNPV infection while novel-22398 was expressed in 72h un-infected larvae.

Differentially expressed miRNAs in BmNPV infected silkworm              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165865.t003To confirm the Solexa sequencing results, 10 miRNAs were selected to perform stem loop qRT-PCR assay. One was an identified novel miRNA and the remaining nine were known miRNAs. Among the known miRNAs, six were up-regulated and three were down-regulated. Half of the up-regulated miRNAs had a log2FC value >5 and the remaining half had a value between 2 and 5. Except for bmo-miR-1175-5p, which showed no significant difference between BmNPV infected and un-infected larvae, the remaining 9 miRNAs showed an expression pattern similar to the Solexa sequencing data (Fig 3B).Gene ontology analysis to predict target genes for differentially expressed miRNAsGO analysis was performed to those predict target genes for differentially expressed miRNAs. The resulting genes were classified into three categories; cellular component, molecular function and biological process (Fig 4). The top five ranked GO terms were cell, cell part, binding, catalytic and cellular process that together accounted for more than 50%. Nearly 6% of the target genes were involved in virion, virion part, immune system process and response to stimulus.

Dnmt2 (NM_001043469.1) was predicted to be one of the target genes for miR-277-5p using miRNA seed region binding to the 3’UTR of Dnmt2 mRNA with mfe (minimum free energy) -20.1kcal/mol (Fig 5A). To further validate the positive interaction between miR-277-5p and Dnmt2, dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed. As predicted, we found that the luciferase activity decreased significantly in 293 cells co-transfected with PmirGLO-Dnmt2 and miR-277-5p mimic when compared to the negative control, which indicated that miR-277-5p can directly regulated Dnmt2. To confirm whether miR-277-5P specifically inhibited Dnmt2, the mutated reporter was constructed. Overexpression of miR-277-5p has no effects on luciferase activity in the PmirGLO-Dnmt2-mut transfected cells (Fig 5B and 5C). These results suggested that Dnmt2 was one of the target genes for miR-277-5p.

Studies on this virus thus far, have demonstrated its proliferation within the host through a cascade of viral gene expression and identifying host resistant genes against BmNPV infection [27–28]. However, the molecular mechanism of BmNPV-host interaction remains poorly understood. Studies over the years have shown evidences for the contribution of cellular miRNAs as well as viral miRNAs to host immunity and host-pathogen interaction by regulating the expression of host or pathogen related genes in various organisms [29–31]. However, the roles of silkworm miRNAs in BmNPV infection have not been investigated. In order to detect potential silkworm miRNA involved in BmNPV infection, in this study, we constructed two small RNA libraries from BmNPV-infected and un-infected larvae. Small RNA deep sequencing results revealed a total of 373 known and 73 novel silkworm miRNAs, among which, 38 differentially expressed miRNAs in BmNPV-infected silkworm were screened. Then, target gene prediction for these differentially expressed miRNAs was carried out and the results revealed thousands of targets. We analyzed the gene function of all of the predicted targets according to Go analysis attempting to obtain a glancing description on potential genes related to BmNPV infection. The results showed that the majority of predicted target genes were involved in cell, binding, catalytic, and cellular process, which is consistent with the results of miRNAs response to BmCPV infection [19]. Meanwhile, we also found a small amount of target genes were involved in immune system process, response to stimulus and virion part indicating these genes and the correspondent miRNAs may have potential roles in silkworm-BmNPV interaction and need to be studied in the future.Subsequently, we confirmed differential expression of 9 miRNAs in BmNPV-infected silkworm larvae using stem-loop qRT-PCR. Out of these, we found that the expression of miR-282 was induced by BmNPV infection. MiR-282 is reported to regulate viability, longevity and egg production in Drosophila. The nervous system-specific adenylate cyclase is a target of miR-282, and one of the main functions of miR-282 is the regulation of adenylate cyclase activity in the nervous system during metamorphosis [32]. Ame-miR-282, encoded by Apis mellifera L., is down regulated in dancing honey bees compared to foraging honey bees. The target genes of ame-miR-282 were also found to be associated with kinase, neural function, synaptotagmin and energy indicating that ame-miR-282 could play a role in regulating the dancing behaviors in honey bees [33]. In this study, up-regulation of miR-282 upon BmNPV infection suggesting miR-282 may be involved in BmNPV infection.In addition, miR-10-5p was also found to up-regulate in BmNPV infected silkworm larvae indicating that miR-10-5p may also play a role in BmNPV infection. Spodoptera exigua miR-10-1a has been shown to be differentially expressed during the larval stages. Oral feeding experiments using synthetic miR-10-1a mimic can suppress the growth of S. exigua and increased mortality [34].Among the 9 differential expressed miRNA, we found several studies have reported the potential functions of miR-277. For example, miR-277 expression was induced in response to parasitization by the Glyptapanteles flavicoxis parasitoid [35]. Drosophila miR-277 is down regulated during the adult life, and controls branched-chain amino acid catabolism. Constitutive miR-277 expression shortens lifespan [36] and plays a role as a metabolic switch controlling amino acid catabolism by targeting the metabolic pathway enzymes [37]. MiR-277 has been also reported to be associated with freeze tolerance in insects [38] and to modulate rCGG repeat-mediated neurodegeneration [39].In this study, we found that miR-277-5p was significantly up-regulated in BmNPV infected silkworm larvae. To explore whether miR-277-5p play roles in silkworm-BmNPV interaction, we investigated the target gene of miR-277-5p. Based on bioinformatics prediction and dual-luciferase reporter assay, we confirmed the positive interaction between miR-277-5p and Dnmt2. Dnmt2 is both a cytoplasmic and a nuclear protein [40] that specially methylating cellular tRNAs. Cytosine-5 methyltransferases of the Dnmt2 family are highly conserved through evolution and their biological function has been studied in several organisms. For instance, Dnmt2 is required for an efficient innate immune response in Drosophila. Dnmt2 mutant flies accumulate increasing levels of Drosophila C virus and show activated innate immune responses [41]. Overexpression of Dnmt2 can prolong the life span of Drosophila and increased the resistance to stress [42]. Drosophila Dnmt2 loss-of-fuction mutants showed decreased viability under stress conditions [43]. Dnmt2 is also essential for the efficient functioning of Dicer-2 (Dcr-2) in Drosophila [44]. Infection with Wolbachia can disrupt the genome-wide patterns of cytosine methylation in Aedes aegypti [45]. Mosquitoes infected with the dengue virus induces expression of Dnmt2 while when mosquitoes introduced endosymbiont, Wolbachia, the expression of Dnmt2 is significantly decreased. Interestingly, overexpression of Dnmt2 in mosquito cells led to inhibition of Wolbachia replication, but significantly promoted replication of dengue virus, suggesting a causal link between this Wolbachia manipulation and the blocking of dengue replication in Wolbachia infected mosquitoes [46]. Together, these studies implicated that Dnmt2 is functional for cellular stress responses at least in adult flies and mosquito.In the present study, we speculated that BmNPV infection induced the expression of miR-277-5p, which led to regulate the expression of Dnmt2 gene. Cleavage of tRNA is a conserved response to several stress stimuli in eukaryotes [47]. Dnmt2-mediated methylation protected tRNA from stress-induced ribonuclease cleavage [43]. Down-regulation of Dnmt2 caused reduced methylation of cellular tRNAs, as a result, some tRNA frgaments are produced to repress translation by displacing translation initiation and elongation from mRNAs or by interfering with efficient transpeptidation [41]. Further experiments are necessary to demonstrate the precise function of Dnmt2 in BmNPV-host interaction.In summary, the present study provides the firstly genome-wide characterization of miRNAs in BmNPV infected silkworm. The differentially expressed miRNAs between BmNPV-infected and un-infected silkworm are expected to offer new insights to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the BmNPV-host interactions. Further studies are necessary to validate the function of the related miRNAs and predicted target genes in silkworm.Supporting InformationS1 Table.

Regular grammar and regular expressions generate regular languages, and finite automata is a computation model of speech recognition for regular languages [1]. Finite automata is widely used in areas such as text processing [2], compilation [3], pattern matching [4, 5], network intrusion detection and protection [6, 7], image analysis and spatial dynamics [8, 9]. Finite automata mainly have two alternative implementations: nondeterministic finite automatons (NFAs) and deterministic finite automatons (DFAs). DFAs are used widely because they have predictable and acceptable memory bandwidth requirements. Regular expressions are usually used to describe engineering requirements in practice, and they can be converted into a DFA by a sequence of operations [10, 11]. To save memory space, the minimization of a DFA is indispensable in practical applications. In this paper, we focus on the minimization problem without considering the conversion from regular expressions or regular grammar to DFA.It has been proven theoretically that a DFA has a unique minimal formalization, but only up to isomorphism [3]. This means that the minimal DFA is unique, and has the least number of states needed to recognize a language represented by regular expressions or regular grammar. The minimization of a DFA is beneficial not only for practical applications, but also mathematical problems in theory. Many algorithms can be used to minimize a DFA, and these can be classified into four categories.The first category uses a series of refinements of a partition on the state set. A typical method is mentioned in [12], and has time complexity O(n2). Hopcroft’s and Moore’s algorithms also fall into this category. At present, Hopcroft’s algorithm is the most efficient known algorithm and has a worst-case time of O(n log n) [13]. Several authors [14, 15] have proven the tightness of the upper bound of this complexity for different families of automata. Hopcroft’s algorithm has recently been extended to handle incomplete DFAs [16, 17], and has now been re-described many times to make it easier to understand [18, 19]. Moore’s algorithm is much simpler than Hopcroft’s algorithm. However, it leads to a quadratic worst-case time complexity [20, 21].The second type of minimization algorithm uses a sequence of merging states. The most famous algorithm of this type is Revuz’s algorithm, which has a linear time complexity. The disadvantage of Revuz’s algorithm is that it is constrained to acyclic automata [22]. Almeida and Zeitoun extended it to automata whose nontrivial strongly connected components are cycles [23, 24].In the third category, Brzozowski’s algorithm reverses and trims the automaton twice to obtain the minimal DFA [25]. Recently, studies on automaton minimization algorithms have mainly focused on incremental construction and dynamic DFA minimization, which is the fourth classification. Daciuk proposed an incremental algorithm for minimizing finite state automata that allows the minimization to be merged with the construction in a single step by adding new strings one by one and minimizing the resulting automaton on-the-fly [26]. Another incremental determinization algorithm for general finite automata called ISC is presented in [27]. Finally, the dynamic minimization solution proposed by Carrasco and Forcada keeps an automaton minimal when insertions or deletions are performed [28].The previously proposed approaches have two main drawbacks. On the one hand, previous methods cannot be used on complicated automata; they are only suitable for acyclic automata, local automata, or other special automata. Automata that have distinguishable accepted states are generally used in many applications, such as network intrusion detection and image analysis. However, only Hopcroft’s algorithm can minimize such DFAs. On the other hand, many algorithms are too complicated, slow, and difficult to implement. Along with the increases in size and topological complexity of DFAs in practice, the time consumed by minimization becomes increasingly important. In this paper, an efficient minimization algorithm is presented that can be used on various automata and is efficient in practice. The main contributions of this paper are as follows.A minimization algorithm based on backward depth information is proposed. We define backward depth and prove the correctness of a partition based on this information.Refinements based on a hash algorithm are introduced to obtain the final minimal DFA. The efficiency of this algorithm is explained and proven experimentally.The proposed algorithm can obtain greater generality and time efficiency. Specifically, it can be efficiently implemented in scenarios where the automata has a more complicated topology complexity.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: firstly, some definitions and propositions related to the minimal DFA and proposed algorithm are stated. Then, we present the detailed steps for obtaining a minimal DFA: building backward depth information, hash table refinement with hash collision checking. In addition, the experiments and results for evaluating the efficiency of the algorithm are presented. Finally, we concludes the paper with a discussion on practical time efficiency, application range, and possible extensions.PreliminariesIn order to illustrate the proposed minimization algorithm more clearly, some preliminaries that relate to the minimization of DFA are presented. First, some related concepts are defined, such as DFA, minimal DFA, and partition [12, 29]. Next, a series of propositions that are used in the algorithm are introduced, and the proofs can be found in S1 File.DFA. A DFA can be defined as a five-tuple D = < Q, Σ, δ, q0, F >, whereQ is a finite set of DFA states.Σ is a finite set of input symbols.δ: Q × Σ → Q is a transition function.q0 ∈ Q is the initial state.F ⊂ Q is the accepted state set.Given word w = a1a2 ⋯ an(a1, a2, ⋯, an ∈ Σ) as the input, the current state will be transformed into the sequence according to transition function δ. This transition function can be extended into a function , where , Σ* represents the set of words that composed by input symbols. If , then word w is recognized. A DFA can be expressed in other formals including a state transition table or state transition digraph. The state transition digraph and state transition table for regular expressions RE = (ab. * cd, ef. * gh) are given in Fig 1 and Table 1, respectively. The dot-star notation “.*” in the regular expressions represents any number of repetitions of any character. Because there are too many edges in the graph for the automata, unlabeled dashed edges represent the transitions that have the same next state for different symbols that have not been shown. In Table 1, where S represents the states in the automata, the accepted states are bold, Σ denotes the symbol set, and the transitions are listed.

State transition table for regular expressions (ab.*cd, ef.*gh).              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165864.t001The function of DFA D is to recognize regular language L, and this can be formally expressed as . However, there are many DFAs that have different numbers of states for a regular expression set. If two DFAs D and D′ recognize the same regular expression set, then D and D′ are equivalent, which is denoted as L(D) ≡ L(D′). In the sense of isomorphism, there exists a minimal DFA that has the fewest number of states. A minimal DFA is defined as follows.Minimal DFA. If DFA M is minimal, then there is no other DFA M′ that has fewer states and is equivalent to DFA M.The minimal DFA for any regular language is unique up to isomorphism, and this has been proved [3]. The transformation from a DFA to an equivalent minimal DFA is called the minimization. In a normal DFA, the essential cause of redundant states is that it has equivalent states. We present the definition of equivalent states as follows.Equivalent States. Suppose that p ∈ Q, q ∈ Q, and w ∈ Σ* in DFA D = < Q, Σ, δ, q0, F > maintain  and . If states si and sj are either both accepted states or non-accepted states, and si and sj are equivalent when they are accepted states, then states p and q are said to be equivalent, which denoted as p ≡ q; otherwise, p and p are distinguishable(p ≢ q).According to the above, the minimization of a DFA can be treated as a problem of determining whether any two states in the state set of the DFA are distinguishable or equivalent. The most straightforward approach to this problem is to examine the consistency of strings that reach accepted states from any two states, that is, verifying Lp(w) ≡ Lq(w) directly, where . However, the cost of doing so is great. For a cyclic automaton, it is impossible to enumerate all strings that can go from a certain state to an accepted state. Fortunately, the equivalence of any two states can be determined by the relationship between states or transitions. In this paper, the idea of a partition is adopted to obtain the minimal DFA. All states in the DFA state set are considered as a whole, and the nonequivalent states are found step by step. The minimal DFA is obtained when no equivalent states exist. To explain the algorithm more clearly, we define a partition as follows.Partition. A partition of set E is a family P of nonempty, pairwise, disjoint subsets of E such that . |P| represents the number of subsets in the partition P. If |P| is greater, the partition is more refined.To partition the state set efficiently, the brute force method is discarded, and a series of propositions for distinguishing states are introduced.Proposition 1. For states p ∈ Q, q ∈ Q, if there exists a symbol a that maintains δ(p, a) = s and δ(q, a) = t and furthermore, s and t are distinguishable, then p and q are distinguishable.Proposition 1 proves that the partition can be obtained according to the transitions in the DFA; however, it is an inefficient way to obtain the minimal DFA directly. To improve the efficiency of the minimization, the backward depth is defined and its related propositions are introduced.Backward Depth. The backward depth from state p to accepted state t is defined by the length of the shortest path from p to t, and can be formally denoted as .In other words, the backward depth is the short length of words consumed in the process of state p transfer to accepted state t. The backward depth information for the DFA can be constructed using the reversal DFA and algorithm proposed in the next section. The reversal DFA is defined as follows.Reversal DFA. Reversal DFA R of DFA D is also represented using a five-tuple R = < Q, Σ, δ−, q0, F >. The unique difference between R and D is the reversal transition function δ−: Q × Σ → Q*, where δ−(p, a) = {q|δ(q, a) = p}, and Q* is the power set of Q.The backward depth information can be used to coarsely partition the states according to the following proposition.Proposition 2. If the backward depths of two states p and q for any accepted state t are different, p and q must be distinguishable. Formally, if BD(p, t) ≠ BD(q, t), then p ≢ q.It is possible that the DFA has many accepted states, so we can obtain the backward depth information of one state to many different accepted states. The state set can be partitioned according to the backward depth information for each accepted state; thus, many partitions are generated. We can refine a partition using the backward depth information according the following proposition.Proposition 3. Given two partitions U and V of set E, we say that W = U ∩ V refines U and V. This means if Ui and Vj are elements of U and V, respectively, then these two elements will be divided into three elements in W, i.e., Wk = Ui ∩ Vj, Wm = Ui\Wk, and Wn = Vj\Wk.To explain it clearly, an example of proposition 3 is given in Fig 2. Different colors represent different elements in the corresponding partitions. Partition U includes two elements represented by red and blue segments, and V also has two parts, colored red and blue. The result W is divided into four segments colored red, blue, green, and yellow.

Example of obtaining a refined partition from coarse partitions.U,V and W represent different partitions for the set E. The bar with different colors represents a subset obtained by the corresponding partition, and the W partition is generated by the intersection of U and V.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165864.g002Although a comparatively refined partition of a state set can be obtained using backward depth information, it may not be the final minimal DFA. To obtain the final minimal DFA, refinement using a hash table is presented in the next section.Minimal DFA Construction AlgorithmThe minimization algorithm proposed in this paper solves the task in two main phases. In the first phase, the backward depth information for every accepted state is generated for each state, and the state set is grouped into many blocks. In the second phase, states in the same block are refined according to the hash table going from the deepest to the shallowest state.Coarse Partitioning by Backward Depth InformationThe task of coarse partitioning is to partition the state set using backward depth information, and then divide it into many blocks. A block is a subset of state set Q, and is getted by the partition operation accoroding to backward depth information. States in one block are not distinguishable according to the backward depth information after coarse partitioning, so they are instead refined using the hash table presented in the next subsection. There are two steps in coarse partitioning: building backward depth information and partitioning the state set using this information according to proposition 3.Instead of the maximum level used by Revuz’s algorithm [22], backward depth information is used to initially partition the state set. The maximum level can only be obtained in acyclic automata, which constrains the application range of corresponding minimization algorithms. The time complexity of Revuz’s algorithm is linear because its target is an acyclic automaton, whose underlying graph is a tree. The algorithm in this paper can run in linear time when the automata is acyclic, and can be used in automata with more high topological complexity.The pseudo-code of building backward depth information is shown in Fig 3. When building backward depth information, the reversal DFA is first constructed (lines 4–9). Then, the reversal DFA is traversed in a breadth-first fashion from one certain accepted state t using a lexicographic sequence to obtain a coarse partition consisting of blocks. The least number of symbols consumed from state s to accepted state t is the backward depth of s to t, denoted as BD(s, t) (lines 10–25). To use backward depth information adequately, the symbols in the shortest path to the state are saved, and then the states that have the same backward depth information are sorted into one block. Thus, the backward depth information is composed by two parts, the backward depth and the last symbol in the shortest path.

Algorithm for building backward depth information.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165864.g003To explain the backward depth information intuitively, the backward depth information for accepted state 19 in the example in Table 1 is shown in Fig 4. The number above the dashed line represents the backward depth to state 19 for the states between the dashed lines, and the states in the same dashed box have the same backward depth information. The backward depth of state 19 is zero, because it consumes no character to reach itself. The states that have a backward depth of four are partitioned into four blocks. This occurs because block generation is determined by the backward depth, the symbol consumed to get to the next state in the graph, and whether the state is an accepted state or not. Block generation based on the backward depth information of an accepted state can be considered to be the shortest path tree whose root is the accepted state obtained from the state transition digraph.

Backward depth information for accepted state “19” in Table 1.The number above the dashed line represents the backward depth, and the states in the same dashed box are in one block. The symbol near the transition is the character consumed in building the shortest path from the state transition graph, and is one part of the backward depth information.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165864.g004The results of building the backward depth information for the example in Fig 4 are shown in Table 2. After building the backward depth information, we obtain the blocks for different accepted states, and these are shown in the corresponding column for the accepted state. The blocks can be further partitioned according to proposition 3, and the final blocks are shown in the last column in Table 2. Consider states p and q: if the backward depth information falls within different blocks for any accepted state, they will be arranged into different blocks.

There are many methods for comparing backward depth information, and the simplest way is direct comparison. However, a direct comparison is costly with respect to time. In this paper, we calculate the hash value (HV) for each state according to the backward information, and then build the hash table. The final blocks can be obtained according to the hash table, that is, if the HVs of two states p and q are equal, they will be located in the same hash table position (HTP), and then they are assigned to the same block, and vice versa. The pseudo-code of coarse partition algorithm based on backward depth information is shown in Fig 5. The backward depth information of state s is denoted as BDI(s), and it is composed by the connection of the backward depth to different accepted states (line 6–8). The hash values and the their positions in the hash table of backward depth information for each state are computed in line 9–11, and then the coarse partition is generated by the hash table (line 13–19).

Coarse partition algorithm based on backward depth information.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165864.g005In Table 2, blocks are created according to the backward depth information for an accepted state, and the final blocks created according to all backward depth information are listed in the last column. The final block partitioning in the last column may be the final minimization. In other words, the minimal DFA may be found without further computation.Refinement Based on Hash TableWhen partitioning using backward depth information, not all information about the automata is used. Any two states that belong to different blocks are demonstrably distinguishable, however, it is possible that states in the same block are not equivalent. Therefore, the final minimal DFA can sometimes not be obtained by the first step. To finish the minimization, we use the transition information to refine the blocks in the coarse partition. That is to say, states in one block may be partitioned into new blocks by a hash table of the transition information.A state in a DFA has many transitions to the next states according to the symbols in the symbol set. A transition is composed of the starting state, symbol, and the ending state, as illustrated in Fig 1. The transitions that have the same starting state are called the state’s transition set. If the transition set of any two states in the same block are different, then the two states are deterministically distinguishable. The refinement of the coarse partition is obtained by a comparison to the transition sets using a hash table. For symbol a, if two states p and q in one block are transferred to different blocks, then p and q must be distinguishable. The correctness of this approach is proved by proposition 1.For blocks that have only one state, it is unnecessary to refine them further. Because blocks are coadjacent according to their transitions, many iterations of refinement could be needed for blocks that have many states. Refinement is terminated when no new blocks are generated. If the original DFA is minimal or acyclic, no iterations are needed. Details of the refinement are given in the following.Suppose the cardinality of block i is ni. The time complexity of directly comparing any two states in the block is then . Instead of directly comparing transition sets, we establish a hash table for every block and use it to perform refinements. The pseudo-code for refinement using a hash table is given in Fig 6. The hash value of state p is denoted as HV(p), and the input of the hash calculation is the transition information of the state, which can be expressed as HV(p) = Hash(BDI−(p)) (line 7). The transition information of the state is computed in line 4–6, where B−(δ(p, c)) represents the information of the block that includes element δ(p, c) (lines 5–9). The position of a state in the corresponding block’s hash table can be obtained by its HV, which is represented as HTP(s) (line 8). If the positions of the different states are the same, we consider the two states to be equivalent; otherwise, they are distinguishable. If states in a block are distinguishable, the block is divided into multiple blocks (lines 11–20). If a block has only one state, the calculations are ignored. If the number of blocks does not increase during refinement, the algorithm terminates.

To explain hash table refinement properly, the coarse partition for accepted state 19 instead of the final coarse partition shown in the last subsection is used. In the first refinement, block 3, which includes states 3, 5, and 6, is separated into blocks 3 (states 3 and 5) and 13 (state 6) because the position of state 6 is not the same as that of states 3 and 5 in the hash table. Similarly, state 14 is separated from block 4, and added to a new block 14. State 15 is moved from block 8 to the new block 15. In the second refinement, no new blocks are generated because there are no states in the same block that have different hash table positions, so the refinement is terminated.

Hash table refinement based on the coarse partition of accepted state 19.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165864.t003The advantage of the hash table is that it has lower time complexity: O(n) compared to the O(n2) of direct comparison. The other noteworthy problem is hash table collision, which occurs when two inputs have the same position although they are different. Distinguishable states will not be found if hash collision occurs among the transition information of these states. In order to guarantee the correctness of the minimal algorithm, an inspection of hash collisions is necessary. This means that the state transition information in the same block must be directly compared once more. The inspections are then performed after the refinements have been terminated, reducing the number of inspections.To maintain the efficiency of the minimal algorithm, hash collisions should occur with low probability. The frequency of hash collisions is influenced primarily by the hash function and size of the hash table. An exclusive-or hash function [30, 31] is selected for the hash calculations in this paper, and the size of the hash table is the number of states in the DFA. Because the hash table is large enough and an exclusive-or hash function has perfect performance, few collisions occur. Usually, there are no collisions. Even when collisions occur, few inspections are needed because only those states who have the same position in the hash table need to be recalculated.The final algorithm mainly consists of the backward depth information-based coarse partitioning and hash table refinement. The minimal DFA for the above-mentioned example is shown in Fig 7. As shown in the figure, states 3 and 5 in the original DFA are equivalent and merged into state 3 in the minimal DFA, states 4 and 9 are merged into state 4, and states 12, 14, and 16 are merged into state 12 in the final minimization of the DFA.

The minimal DFA is equivalent with original DFA functionally, and is isomorphic with the final block within Table 3.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165864.g007Experiments and ResultsTo evaluate the performance of the algorithms in this paper, Hopcroft’s algorithm, which known as the most efficient DFA minimization algorithm and has been utilized for various DFAs, was selected for comparison. The proposed algorithm and Hopcroft’s algorithm were implemented in C++ and run under GNU/Linux on a computer with an Intel processor Core i5 (3.2GHz) and 4 GB DDR3 (800 MHz). In order comprehensively and meaningfully compare the two algorithms, three different classes of automata with increasing topological complexity were tested.At present, there is no standard automata test set for evaluating DFA minimization algorithms. The automata used in this experiment were generated by a workload by Becchi [32], which mainly consists of regular expression generation according to some parameters. An NFA was produced starting from regular expressions using the Thompson method [10], and a DFA was generated by subset construction [12]. Because the topological complexity is mainly determined by wildcard and dot-star terms in regular expression sets, we fix all parameters except for the frequency of wildcard and dot-star terms. The other parameters were set to their default values in the experiment, and the input symbols set Σ was the ASCII alphabet.The experimental results are shown in Fig 8. In this graph, the horizontal axis represents the number of states in the original DFAs, and the vertical axis indicates the time consumed in microseconds. Fig 8(a) and 8(b) show the results for automata with the lowest topological complexity, which do not have any wildcards or dot-star terms in the regular expressions. In this case, the algorithm presented in this paper performs better. This is because the asymptotic time complexity is linear when the automata degrades to an acyclic automata. The results for the automata with medium topological complexity (1% wildcard and dot-star terms) are shown in Fig 8(c). Here, the proposed algorithm does not perform better than Hopcroft’s algorithm. The reason for this is that the proposed algorithm encounters an imperfect partition based on the backward depth information. As shown in Fig 8(d), the proposed algorithm achieves a better time complexity than Hopcroft’s algorithm for the automata with high topological complexity (3% wildcard and dot-star terms).

Experimental results for automata with different topological complexities.The horizontal axis represents the number of states in the original DFAs, and the vertical axis indicates the time consumed in microseconds.(a) DFA with an underlying graph consisting of a dictionary, (b) DFA with an underlying graph consisting of a tree, (c) DFA with 1% wildcards and dot-star terms, and (d) DFA with 3% wildcards and dot-star terms.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165864.g008The time complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(n + ∑(ni) + k), and is composed of three main aspects. First, the time complexity of the coarse partition is O(n), where n represents the number of states in the original DFA. To obtain the backward depth information, the only operation is the construction of the reversal DFA, which consumes n periods. The time complexity of the refinements on block i without considering hash collisions is O(ni), and there may be many blocks that need to be refined by the hash table. Thus, the total time complexity of the hash table refinements without considering hash collisions is O(∑(ni)). The hash collision inspections consume fewer cycles because there are not many of them. The time complexity of hash collision inspections is O(k), where k is a random number. The hash table refinements account for the highest proportion of the time complexity because they may be iterated many times. The number of refinement iterations is mainly influenced by the DFA’s topological complexity. If the DFA has an underlying graph with low topological complexity, the states are partitioned primarily by the coarse partition, and the algorithm proposed in this paper will consume comparatively few cycles. For the DFA with high topological complexity, although the state set cannot be partitioned in the coarse partitioning, it is partitioned well in the early stages of the hash table refinements.Discussion and ConclusionsThe experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better time complexity in most cases. This is for three main reasons: the mechanism of coarse partitioning according to backward depth information, the highly efficient comparison of transition information using a hash table, and few hash collisions. The backward depth information that is used to obtain the coarse partition is generated when the reversal DFA is constructed. In the partition refinement to obtain the minimal DFA, the transition information is compared by hash table instead of directly, which decreases the time complexity from  to O(ni).In addition to the strong quantitative performance results, the proposed method has substantial qualitative advantages, including greater generality and simplicity. Compared to previous minimization algorithms, the backward depth information can be obtained for any type of DFA. Thus, in contrast to previous work, the algorithm proposed in this paper can be used not only on acyclic automata and automata with simple cycles, but also on topologically complicated automata. The maximum level proposed in Revuz’s algorithm is the longest path from the state to the final state, and if the underlying graph has circles, then the maximum level cannot be obtained. All other algorithms except for Hopcroft’s algorithm have similar disadvantages with respect to DFA minimization generality. Furthermore, the algorithm proposed in this paper can be extended to other types of automata; for example, incomplete DFAs. In an incomplete DFA, states may have no transitions for some symbols; however, this has no influence on the implementation of the algorithm. The main operations consist of the building of backward depth information and hash table refinement, and these operate without considering the integrality of the transitions.In summary, we propose a DFA minimization algorithm based on backward depth information in this paper that is both simple and has better time complexity and greater generality than previous approaches.Supporting InformationS1 File.

Moderate drinking on important occasions is encouraged, but excessive drinking is discouraged through various social sanctions. The ability to consume alcohol without visible effects is admired, but visible intoxication is considered a personal shortcoming and a disgrace for one’s family and colleagues [1–3]. The one exception to this generalization may be business drinking, where drinking challenges and intoxication are part of the business negotiation [2,4]. The implicit rules associated with alcohol use in much of Chinese society, while different from Western rules, may actually encourage lower-risk behaviors. Rehm et al. [5] expressed concern that globalization is potentially leading to the breakdown of these lower-risk indigenous drinking patterns as individuals who are exposed to influences of Western cultures may be introduced to risky alcohol behaviors, such as binge drinking, bar drinking, and viewing intoxication as fun.Cultural orientation is an individual’s identification with traditional cultural values and imported foreign cultural values. Cultural orientation reflects an individual’s cultural preferences as he or she encounters influences imported from an outside culture, such as Western values, while still living in and surrounded by his or her native culture. Foreign influences typically come from mainstream and social media, travel, contact with foreigners, use of foreign products, and trying foreign foods, fashions, and celebrations. As a result, a person’s core cultural values (orientation) are challenged and may change. Cultural orientation differs from acculturation, which occurs when an individual emigrates to another country and adopts aspects of the new country’s culture. Today, globalization makes changes in cultural orientation more likely, especially in countries like China that are experiencing new and increasing exposure to foreign influences. Some researchers [6] suggest it be called “globalization-based acculturation”, but we prefer the term orientation because it builds on the earlier work of Eide and Acuda [7] who first coined the phrase “cultural orientation.” Because cultural orientation measures individual orientation towards both the indigenous and foreign cultures, it is useful for examining how cultural influences impact drinking behaviors in the presence of conflicting cultures. This paper explores the associations of cultural orientation with alcohol use by Chinese university students.Cultural orientation and its contribution in explaining some of the variances in individual alcohol use by young people was first reported the 1990s by Eide and Acuda [7–9]. Eide et al.[8] defined cultural orientation in terms of behavioral indicators, such as an interest in Western, nontraditional practices. Their study of the relationship of cultural orientation to alcohol use among high-school students in Zimbabwe described Western cultural orientation as being associated with a higher probability of alcohol use, while a Zimbabwean orientation was associated with a lower probability of alcohol use [7]. Cultural orientation has been largely overlooked in studies of the effects of globalization on alcohol use in China. However, studies in China by Xue et al.[10], Qian et al.[11], Shell et al.[12], and Tang et al.[13] found that Chinese high-school and college students who expressed higher Western cultural orientation were more likely to consume alcohol. This study sought to extend this prior work by examining, in a different sample of students, the associations of cultural orientation with college student drinking in China while controlling for known drinking influences.The Present StudyThe current study examined the associations of cultural orientation with alcohol use among Chinese university students. The principal hypothesis for this study was that a more Western cultural orientation would be associated with more frequent drinking. Our objective was not to propose cultural orientation as the most important factor in explaining drinking patterns, but to provide a different perspective on the role of cultural influences in drinking behavior. Many variables influence drinking behaviors. To examine the association of cultural orientation with drinking beyond prominent known influences, we controlled for age [14], gender[15] and rural-urban hometown[16].The results of this study are both empirically and practically significant in an era of increasing globalization. Empirically, they expand our understanding of the associations between cultural influences and drinking behavior among university-aged students. Previous studies of cultural orientation in China have primarily focused on high school students[10–12], and have shown that students with a more Western cultural orientation had a higher likelihood of drinking compared to younger students with a more Chinese cultural orientation. The only previous study of cultural orientation and drinking behavior among college students had similar results to the high-school student studies, but it was limited to only one city [13]. The present study involved surveying students from several universities in three geographically distinct areas of the country. The replication of Tang’s findings [13] in a different and more geographically diverse sample would provide additional empirical evidence of the effects of cultural orientation on drinking behavior and strengthen the external validity of these results. This area of research is important to further understand drinking behavior by young people in an era of globalization by increasing awareness of cultural orientation as a potentially significant factor to be considered in developing alcohol and public health policies in the world’s most populous country and by contributing to the knowledge being assembled to direct efforts to reduce alcohol’s overall contribution to the burden of disease.MethodEthical ConsiderationsThe ethical review for research with human subjects was conducted by the IRB of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (Approval #20110411707EP). The UNLIRB waived informed consent procedures. Officials from the participating universities in China approved the study.Sampling and Data GatheringA total of 1,439 students completed the questionnaire. Students were enrolled in 13 universities in Beijing (northern China), Kunming (southwestern China), and Wuhan (central China) and were from hometowns all over China. Trained data collectors gathered the data in existing undergraduate classes. All students in attendance on the survey day completed the survey. The survey, written in Chinese, included a cover page informing the students of the purpose of the study, instructions on how to complete the scales, an assurance of anonymity and confidentiality, a statement of their right to not answer questions without affecting their standing, and a notification that the university authorities had approved the project. Approximately equal numbers of students in each university completed the survey.Prior to analysis, questionnaires with missing responses on more than half of the cultural orientation items or with contradictory answers in the alcohol use questions were eliminated. The total remaining questionnaires 1,305 (91%) were included in the analysis. There was no specific pattern of demographics in the 134 surveys dropped from the analysis that would affect the result of the analysis. The final sample was 40% male and 60% female, ages between 17 and 30 years (M = 20.24, SD = 1.73). Of these, 62% were freshmen, 15% sophomores, 11% juniors, 6% seniors, and 6% graduate students. Sixty-four percent of the students were from urban hometowns (cities and counties), and 35% were from rural areas (towns and villages).Cultural Orientation QuestionnaireThe instrument used in this study was a revised version of the Chinese Cultural Orientation Questionnaire (CCOQ) developed by Shell et al.[12] and Xue [10,17,18]. The CCOQ was originally developed for use with high-school-age students. Based on interviews with university students Wang[19] created the current university student version, which was then used by Tang et al.[13]. Details of scale development and complete psychometric and validation information for the CCOQ are available from these sources.The final cultural orientation questionnaire consisted of 67 items that were answered on a 5-point Likert scale: 1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree; 3 = neither disagree nor agree; 4 = agree; 5 = strongly agree. The Chinese cultural orientation factor was measured with five sub-factors: respect for elders (“I would listen until elders finish talking even though I disagree”), filial piety (“I would do whatever my parent wants me to do”), pride in being Chinese (“I am proud of China’s long history”), collectivism (“I give priority to group interests rather than individual ones”), and harmony (“I won’t show off my strengths to avoid upsetting others”). The Western cultural orientation factor was measured with four sub-factors: dating attitudes (“I feel uncomfortable seeing couples show intimacy in public”), interest in Western culture (“I appreciate the context of Western culture that emphasizes freedom and taking it easy in life”), consumerism (“I would rather buy something that makes me happy than deposit money in the bank”), and personal appearance preference (“I like to dye my hair like Westerners’ hair”). A confirmatory factor analysis with these nine first-order factors and two second-order factors was used. Based on Hu & Bentler’s[20] two-index presentation strategy (SRMR and a supplementing index such as RMSEA), two fit indices RMSEA = .047< .06, and SRMR = .065< .08 indicated a good model fit. (In addition, χ2 (1530) = 5886.244, p< .05 and CFI = .673 did not show good fit; however, χ2 is sensitive to sample size and model complexity. The SRMR with one other fit index was adequate for model evaluation based on the two-index presentation strategy). In addition, the correlation between the two cultural orientations was nonsignificant, confirming the bidimensional model theory that assumes an individual’s orientations toward the two cultures are independent. Therefore, the two second-order cultural orientations were used as two separate continuous variables in the following analysis (as in Shell et al. [12]). Factor scores for the two second-order orientations (Chinese and Western) were then generated automatically from the model by Mplus. The Cronbach’s α for Chinese cultural orientation was .83, and for Western cultural orientation, it was .80.Drinking MeasuresDrinking frequency was obtained by asking students to report their drinking in both the last 30 days and the last 12 months. Students were divided into three drinking categories: nondrinkers (had not used alcohol in the 12 months), drinkers (had drunk in the last year but not in the last 30 days), and recent drinkers (had drunk alcohol in the last 30 days). This classification is broad, resulting in only three drinking categories, but our experience in China has been that narrower definitions become increasingly inaccurate for a number of reasons. In China, there is no standardized alcohol serving size, no standardized alcohol container size, greater variability in the percentage of alcohol by volume in different drinks, and drinking practices involving frequent topping up, mixing different drinks on a drinking occasion, and encouraging others to drink, making it difficult to recall what was actually consumed [21,22]. Drinking alcohol is legal for Chinese university students. There is a law prohibiting sale of alcohol to people under age 18, but it is largely ignored. There is no minimum age law for possessing or consuming alcohol.Demographic questions asked students for their gender, age, and hometown (to identify students from rural and urban backgrounds).ResultsDemographic Characteristics and Cultural OrientationA one-way ANOVA (Table 1) showed that males and students from urban areas had significantly lower Chinese cultural orientation (Mean = -.03, F = 8.22 for male; Mean = -.01, F = 5.93 for urban) and higher Western cultural orientation (Mean = .02, F = 4.87 for male; Mean = .04, F = 40.30 for urban).

Cultural orientation differences by hometown and gender.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165858.t001For the drinking behaviors, 19% of the sample had not consumed alcohol in the 12 months (nondrinkers), 42% had consumed alcohol in the last 12 months but not in the last 30 days (drinkers), and 39% had consumed alcohol in the last 30 days (recent drinkers). The three types of drinkers showed significant differences in Western cultural orientation, with the recent drinkers group having the most Western orientation (M = .07, F = 20.07), but no significant difference in their Chinese cultural orientation.Associations of Cultural Orientation with Alcohol UseFor the main research question, we used a hierarchical logistic regression [23] to assess the association of cultural orientation with alcohol use above other common factors known to be associated with drinking. With nondrinkers as the reference group (Table 2), a block of demographic indicators (age, gender, and urban/rural hometown) were entered into the model in step 1, and then the two cultural orientation factors (Chinese and Western) as a block were entered in step 2, in which the three demographic variables became the controlling block.

Hierarchical logistic regression.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165858.t002When comparing a student’s odds of being a drinker with the odds of being a nondrinker, none of these variables was significant in either step 1 or step 2. However, as seen in step 1, when comparing the odds of recent drinking to nondrinking, age (OR = 1.14, p = .01), gender/being male (OR = 3.88, p< .01), and urban hometown (OR = 1.60, p = .01) all significantly increased the odds of recent drinking. In step 2, after the two cultural orientation variables were added, age (OR = 1.14, p = .02) and gender/being male (OR = 3.80, p < .01) were still significant predictors of drinking behaviors. Therefore, compared with the odds of nondrinking, participants’ odds of recent drinking increased by 1.14 times with each increase in age of one year; the odds of male students being recent drinkers were 3.80 times those of female students. Western cultural orientation (OR = 3.71, p< .01) also significantly increased the odds of recent drinking, by 3.71 times for every point scored higher on the Western cultural orientation scale. By contrast, Chinese cultural orientation did not significantly associate with the odds of recent drinking (OR = 1.10, p = 0.75). Hometown became non-significant (OR = 1.39, p = .07) after adding the two cultural orientation variables in step 2.DiscussionThis study suggested that cultural orientation explains additional variance in young Chinese people’s drinking behaviors beyond the expected variances explained by age, gender, and urban/rural residence. This study extends our understanding of cultural influence on drinking behaviors. Previous studies have suggested that, at the country level, as China became more westernized, the traditional Chinese patterns of drinking of its population would erode [2, 24]. This study showed such a trend at the individual level, measured as the association of cultural orientation and drinking in Chinese university students. The results showed that even taking age, gender, and urban/rural background into account, Western cultural orientation was the second most important factor, after gender, associated with Chinese college students’ drinking. The more a student adopted a Western cultural orientation, the more likely he/she was to be a recent drinker. Our results extend the findings of Xue et al.[10, 18] and Shell et al.[12] among Chinese high-school students to university students, and add empirical support for the findings of Tang et al.[13] with a more diverse sample. The sample is not representative of all Chinese university students, but obtaining such a sample for an initial study, like the one presented here, is not practical. In addition, our results are similar to those from earlier studies from Zimbabwe[7–9] about the positive relationship between Western cultural orientation and drinking. In this sense, our study provided additional empirical evidence for the need to consider cultural influences on alcohol use, especially in regions of the world that have drinking patterns and drinking traditions that differ from what is found in North America and Europe.The socio-demographic characteristics of this sample were consistent with samples in previous studies of alcohol use by this age group in China [15,16]. The male university students in our sample drank more than the females did. Simultaneously, the male students also had higher scores on Western cultural orientation than did the female students. This could suggest that there are both direct and indirect associations of gender on drinking through cultural orientation, which is consistent with Shell et al.’s findings [12]. Drinking increased with age among this group of students. The positive association of age with drinking was different from that in some of the previous literature [14, 25], which made inferences for the entire adult population. Such an inconsistency may suggest that the relationship between age and drinking is not linear. It is possible that drinking increases with age among young people and decreases when people get older. The urban/rural difference in drinking behavior (step 1) disappeared after adding cultural orientation (step 2). However, urban students also had lower scores on Chinese cultural orientation and higher scores on Western cultural orientation compared to rural students. This suggests that differences in rural/urban drinking could be the result of rural/urban differences in cultural orientation, assuming that rural populations are more insulated from foreign influences than are urban populations. This suggests a more complicated picture of the socio-demographic characteristics and drinking behaviors when considering the possible role of culture in drinking.So far, all the studies on the influence of cultural orientation on drinking behaviors in China, including the current study, have looked at drinking frequency. It is possible that cultural orientation could also be associated with the quantity and type of alcohol consumed. In our study, the socio-demographic characteristics and cultural orientation scores failed to differentiate between drinkers and nondrinkers, while Chinese cultural orientation showed no association with recent drinking. It is possible that there is an association between Chinese cultural orientation and the quantity of people’s drinking; however, as stated earlier, accurate quantity measures are very difficult to obtain. There are no agreed-upon standard drink serving size or standard alcohol containers, there is considerable variability in alcohol by volume, and Chinese drinking practices, such as topping up and mixing different types of alcohol on a single drinking occasion, all make it difficult to report with accuracy the quantity of alcohol consumed. This limitation weakens our conclusion about cultural orientation and drinking behaviors, suggesting that future studies need to develop questionnaires to quantify alcohol intake. In addition, future studies may wish to explore the associations between cultural orientation and different types of alcohol, by including a question on beverage preference: beer, wine or spirits.ImplicationsRehm et al.[5] expressed concern that globalization is leading to the emergence of less favorable drinking patterns, especially in some regions such as the Western Pacific Region that includes China which have country-level drinking patterns that are less detrimental than those in other regions of the world [26]. This study, at the individual level, suggests a role that cultural orientation may play in the changing patterns of university students’ drinking. Cultural orientation provides an added perspective to the general understanding of cultural influences and acculturation because it reflects cultural values that are present in individuals who have not left their home environment but appear to have been influenced by “outside” cultural forces. Where indigenous cultural values are associated with lower risk patterns of drinking, alcohol policies and education programs may wish to consider how to reinforce the cultural values that reduce alcohol-related risks—values such as moderation, drinking with meals, and viewing intoxication as social embarrassment. Education programs can also consider challenging higher risk drinking patterns of foreign cultures, especially when these other cultures are seen as appealing.Supporting InformationS1 Dataset.

It is also firmly established that mechanical loading of bone results in increased bone formation and remodeling[1, 2]. However, when physiological mechanical stimulation is absent, for example, during exposure to an environment of microgravity, after prolonged bed rest or following joint immobilization after surgery, bone resorption increases and bone mass is lost[3, 4]. Mechanical loading of bone in vivo causes tissue deformation and results in the application of mechanical stimulation to cells embedded in the bone matrix, and the activity of bone cells is regulated in response to the changes in mechanical environments[1, 5]. In order to investigate the mechanical response of cells, a variety of methods have been employed to simulate the stress environment of osteocytes and osteoblasts in the mineralized matrix of bone, including fluid shear stress, cyclic stretch, continuous compressive force and mechanical stress generated by liquid perfusion or compressed air[6–10]. However, the response of monolayer osteoblasts to mechanical stress generated by liquid drops has never been reported. It is widely accepted that physiological mechanical loading leads to an anti-apoptotic effect and increased proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts which results in extracellular matrix formation[2, 6, 11–13]. At present, some studies have suggested that mechanical overloading acts as a negative regulator of bone formation and induces cell apoptosis, but the precise cellular mechanism is poorly understood[7, 14–16].Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a physiological process leading to elimination of unwanted cells within living tissues, which is essential in the regulation of tissue turnover in long-lived mammals[17]. Apoptosis of osteoblasts is a significant event in bone, as approximately 70% of osteoblasts are thought to undergo apoptosis in the process of bone remodeling[18]. In bone tissue, regulation of osteoblast apoptosis is thought to play a key role in the maintenance of healthy bone and skeletal architectural integrity[19–21].Extracellular stimuli, such as mechanical stimuli, growth factors, and oxidative stress, activate key intracellular signaling pathways, in particular, PI3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), to stimulate cytoplasmic and nuclear effectors which regulate various cellular functions involving cell growth, differentiation, cytokine production and apoptosis[22–25]. It has been determined that the effect of mechanical stress is mediated by these two signaling pathways[6, 26–28]. Although they belong to the same family of intracellular signaling regulators, the three major MAPKs, which include extracellular signal-regulated kinase p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK (p38) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), play different roles in cells in response to mechanical stimulation, and their effects on mechanical stress-induced apoptosis are still controversial[10, 14, 15]. It has been shown that ERK activated by moderate mechanical stretch contributes to differentiation of osteoblasts and does not affect apoptosis[15], while other studies have reported that ERK inhibits apoptosis induced by cyclic stretch in osteoblasts[14]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that ERK contributes to cell apoptosis induced by static mechanical stress[10]. JNK activated by large-magnitude mechanical stretch not only suppresses differentiation but also leads to cell apoptosis[15]. Finally, p38 that is activated by large-magnitude mechanical stretch induces local recruitment of pre-osteoclasts and subsequent osteoclastogenesis; however, it may also lead to apoptosis when activated by static mechanical stress[10, 15].The growth of cells is also regulated through the PI3K/Akt pathway[29]. It has been reported that inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway can induce cell death[30]. Phosphorylated Akt functions as a survival signal partially by inactivating two pro-apoptotic proteins, Bad and caspase-9[31]. Studies using MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts suggest that mechanical stimulation such as fluid shear stress serves as a signal to inhibit apoptosis through activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway[1]. However, the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by different levels of mechanical stress has not been well documented, and the anti-apoptotic effect may change as the levels of stress change.In this study, we used a device to simulate the stress environment of osteoblasts by applying mechanical loading generated by water drops on monolayer cells to test the hypothesis that the apoptotic effect in osteoblasts is regulated by different levels of mechanical stress. To investigate the mechanism underlying mechanical stress regulation of apoptosis in osteoblasts, we tested the activation of MAPKs and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and demonstrated that mechanical stimulation regulated osteoblast apoptosis by activating the MAPKs and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways at different levels of stress. In particular, we observed that JNK and Akt had opposing effects on apoptosis by regulating Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3 activation, which resulted in inhibition of apoptosis upon small-magnitude stress and increased apoptosis upon large-magnitude stress. This study thus provides preliminary findings on the regulatory mechanism of osteoblast apoptosis under mechanical stress and offers a new method to simulate the stress environment of osteoblasts.Materials and MethodsAntibodies and reagentsAntibodies against phospho-ERK(Thr202/Tyr204) MAPK, phospho-SAPK/JNK(Thr183/Tyr185), phospho-p38(Thr180/Tyr182) MAPK, ERK MAPK, SAPK/JNK, p38 MAPK, phospho-Akt(Ser473), Akt, Bad, phospho-Bad(Ser136), Bax, Bcl-2, β-Actin (13E5), Caspase-3, Cleaved caspase-3 and the appropriate anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, USA.

The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection substrate was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA.Cell culture and mechanical stress applicationOsteoblasts were isolated from the calvaries from neonatal rats (7 days) under a protocol approved by the animal research committee of PLA Second Military Medical University. Calvaries were isolated aseptically and minced and digested with 0.25% trypsin for 30 minutes at 37°C. The slices were then digested with 0.2% collagenase II at 37°C for 4 hours. Cells released were pooled and cultured in dulbecco's modified eagle medium/f12 (DMEM/F12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere incubator containing 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C with medium changed every other day. Cells were passaged when they were 90–95% confluent by trypsinization and seeded at a density of approximately 104 cells/cm2 on round glasses (φ = 25mm) covered with poly-lysine. Cells on glasses were exposed to cyclic mechanical stress when they were 90–95% confluent at a density of approximately 1×105 cells /cm2 and the number of cells on each glass was about 5×105(Fig 1).

Diagrammatic representation of the device used for cyclic compressive stress.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165845.g001Briefly, thin cover glass plates were placed over the confluent cell layers on the glasses. The cyclic mechanical stress was adjusted by drops of PBS to the glass plates. Cells were subjected to different frequency (Hz) and height (cm) of mechanical stress for 30min. The frequency was calculated using the following equation:“t” represented time span between two drops(s). Control cells were covered with a thin glass plate without any liquid dropping on it. The experiment of mechanical stress application was performed in a humidified atmosphere incubator containing 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C in which the temperature, humidity, oxygen content and pH were controlled strictly.TUNEL stainingAfter treatment of mechanical stress, TUNEL staining was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 2 minutes on ice. Washed twice in PBS, the cells were then incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 h at 37°C. After washed with PBS, cells were stained with DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 5 minutes and fluorescent images were acquired under a fluorescence microscope. Evaluations of cell apoptosis were performed independently by two observers in a blinded fashion. A minimum of 6 fields were randomly selected and TUNEL-positive cells (cells with DNA fragmentation and condensed nuclei) were counted in each field. Representative images matching the conclusions were presented. The percentage of positive cells was calculated by (number of positive cells/total number of cells)×100%.Caspase-3 activity assayThe activity of caspase-3 was determined by cleavage of chromogenic caspase substrates, the chromophore DEVD-p-nitroaniline (pNA), which is a caspase-3 substrate using the caspase-3 activity assay kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Briefly, after treatment of mechanical stress, cells were lysed by using lysis buffer for 15 min on ice, and centrifuged at a speed of 18,000rpm for 15 min at 4°C. Each of the protein samples was then added to the reaction buffer containing DEVD-pNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The absorbance of pNA was detected using a microplate spectrophotometer (Biotek, USA) at 405 nm. Caspase-3 activity was quantified as the fold of enzymatic activity in apoptotic samples compared to that of control samples.Flow cytometric analysisCell apoptosis was analyzed using Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) by flow cytometry according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were harvested after mechanical stress application and washed three times with PBS and resuspended in binding buffer. Then, cells were incubated in Annexin-V/PI at room temperature for 15 min in the dark and analyzed by flow cytometry.Inhibitor treatmentFor inhibitor studies, rat osteoblats were pre-incubated with 10μM PD98059 (ERK MAPK inhibitor), 10μM SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), 10μM SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) or 10μM LY294002 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor) in DMSO for 1 h followed by application of cyclic mechanical stress. Cells supplemented with DMSO (vehicle) without inhibitor were used as controls.Western blot and data quantificationAfter treatment of mechanical stress, cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in a lysis buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Lysates were mixed and incubated on ice for 15 min and then cell debris was spun down at a speed of 14,000rpm for 15 min at 4°C. Concentrations of proteins samples in supernatant were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method with the protein assay kit(Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Equal quantities (20μg) of proteins samples (dissolved in 5× loading buffer) were separated using SDS-PAGE gels (5% stacking gel and a 10% running gel) and then electro-transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes by wet transfer method at 250mA for 30min. After blocking in 5% bovineserum albumin (BSA) in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20(TBST) at room temperature for 1 h, membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies(1:1000 except for ERK(1:2000) and β-actin(1:2000)) overnight at 4°C. After washing with TBST, blots were then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000) at room temperature for 1 h. Protein bands were visualized using ECL reagents. The intensity values of each phosphorylated kinase were quantified using densitometric analysis with ImageJ 1.36 and normalized to the intensity of corresponding total protein bands. Unless otherwise stated, β-actin was used as an internal control.Statistical analysisAll results were presented as the mean±standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance was determined using SPSS 13.0 for Windows by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple comparisons performed with post hoc Bonferroni test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated at least three times.ResultsMechanical stress regulates apoptosis and activation of caspase-3 in osteoblastsTo determine the effects of mechanical stress on osteoblasts apoptosis, cells were treated with different levels of mechanical stress(0.15 Hz×4cm,0.15Hz×8cm, 0.3Hz×8cm, 0.6Hz×8cm, 0.6Hz×16cm)(0 as control) for 30min and then cultured for another 24h and apoptosis was assessed using TUNEL staining and caspase-3 activity assay. Small-magnitude stress of 0.15 Hz×4cm and 0.15Hz×8cm decreased osteoblasts apoptosis compared with that of control. Large-magnitude stress of 0.3Hz×8cm, 0.6Hz×8cm, 0.6Hz×16cm promoted apoptosis in a dose dependent manner (P < 0.05) after mechanical stimulation compared with the control cells. The results of caspase-3 activity assay revealed the same trend. However, small-magnitude stress of 0.15 Hz×4cm and 0.15Hz×8cm decreased caspase-3 activity in osteoblasts significantly (P < 0.05) compared with that of control, as shown in Fig 2. Therefore, the cells were treated with 0.15 Hz×4cm, 0.15Hz×8cm and 0.6Hz×8cm for duration of 30min in the subsequent experiments.

Upon mechanical stress loading, ERK and Akt were strongly activated by small-magnitude stresses but were inhibited by large-magnitude stress respectively (P < 0.05). On the other hand, as the levels of stress increased, phosphorylation of p38 and JNK increased in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05) (Fig 3).

Then the cells were subjected to mechanical loading of 0.6Hz×8cm for 30 min to clarify whether the inhibitors had any effect on mechanical stimulation-induced phosphoralation changes of MAPKs and PI3K/Akt pathways. The results demonstrated that mechanical stimulation increased the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, p38 and Akt compared with control cells (P < 0.05), however, the inhibitors partially blocked this effect (P < 0.05) (Fig 4). Secondly, in order to clarify which pathway mediated the apoptotic effect of mechanical stress, we explored the effect of specific inhibitors on the mechanical stimulation-induced osteoblasts apoptosis. Cell apoptosis was determined by using Annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometric analysis. The results showed that mechanical loading of 0.6Hz×8cm significantly induced apoptosis compared with control cells (P < 0.05). Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway by LY294002 caused a significant increase in mechanical stimulation-induced apoptosis compared with the mechanical loading group (P < 0.05). In addition, JNK inhibitor, SP600125 partly eliminated the apoptotic effect of mechanical stimulation on cell apoptosis (P < 0.05). However, treatment with inhibitors alone had no significant effect on the apoptosis of osteoblasts (Fig 5). The results indicated that activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway exhibited anti-apoptotic properties and JNK signaling pathway was closely associated with inducing of apoptosis.

The results revealed that blocking JNK activity with SP600125 could up-regulate the expression of Bcl-2 and down-regulate the expression of Bax and caspase-3(P < 0.05) but had no significant effect on Bad phosphorylation under mechanical stress. However, PI3K/Akt inhibitor, LY294002 partly blocked the anti-apoptotic properties through up-regulating the expression of Bax and caspase-3 and down-regulating the expression of Bcl-2 and p-Bad (P < 0.05). In addition, inhibition of JNK or PI3K/Akt did not lead to changes of each other (Fig 7). Results from this part of experiment indicated that activation of JNK and Akt by mechanical stress independently resulted in an opposite effect on cell apoptosis via a common Bcl/Bax/caspase-3 apoptotic pathway. The difference was that Bad phosphorylation was not involved in JNK mediated pro-apoptotic effect (Fig 8).

Signaling pathways in regulating the osteoblasts apoptosis.The fine balance of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic effect of mechanical stress on osteoblasts is achieved by the actions of critical signaling pathways and key signaling proteins such as JNK and Akt.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165845.g008DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, our results have demonstrated for the first time the apoptotic effects of mechanical stress generated by liquid drops on monolayer osteoblasts. As this method had never been reported, there were no literature reports to guide us regarding the frequency and magnitude of the applied stress. Therefore, we divided osteoblasts into many experimental groups according to different levels of stress and stress duration in order to detect the apoptotic effect of mechanical stress. For the present report, we have chosen to show the most representative groups. Because the distribution, magnitude and change in stress loads on the monolayer cells were too complex to measure or calculate, the values of all stress levels in each group are represented as frequency (Hz) × height (cm).In the present study, we found an interesting trend in apoptosis by using quantitative TUNEL analysis and caspase-3 activity assays to determine the effects of different levels of mechanical stress on osteoblasts. Our results showed that small-magnitude mechanical stress exerted anti-apoptotic effects on osteoblasts, while large-magnitude mechanical stress reversed this effect and promoted apoptosis. Mechanical stress has been reported to suppress apoptosis in osteoblasts[1, 6, 14, 32], in agreement with our observations, we also found that small-magnitude mechanical stress-treated osteoblasts showed an anti-apoptotic trend. However, as only a relatively small proportion of osteoblasts undergo apoptosis naturally, the difference between stress-treated groups and the control group was not significant by TUNEL analysis. However, results of caspase-3 activity assay demonstrated a significant decrease in the cellular apoptotic rate compared with control cells. Intriguingly, as mechanical stress increased, the number of apoptotic osteoblasts also increased. We propose that combining TUNEL and caspase-3 assays may produce a more reliable result than TUNEL alone to show that the apoptotic effect of mechanical stress in osteoblasts is dose-dependent.There are a number of signaling pathways that can induce apoptosis. Since it has been demonstrated that MAPKs and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways can mediate cell survival[29, 33–36], we examined changes in signaling proteins in these two pathways. Although both signaling pathways were activated by small-magnitude mechanical stress, phosphorylation of Akt and ERK significantly decreased, while phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK increased when large-magnitude mechanical stress was loaded. To explore the relationship between the apoptotic effect of mechanical stress and activation of signaling pathways, we used specific inhibitors to clarify which pathway mediated the apoptotic effect on osteoblasts. We observed that inhibiting the kinase activity of Akt led to an enhanced apoptotic effect, while inhibition of JNK resulted in an anti-apoptotic effect. However, inhibiting the kinase activity of other MAPKs such as p38 and ERK had no effect on apoptosis. These results suggested that JNK and Akt activation participated in the regulation of osteoblast apoptosis when mechanical stress was loaded on the cells.Activation of JNK by large-magnitude mechanical stretch has been reported to result in cellular apoptosis[15]. It was also demonstrated that activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway rescued osteoblasts from TNF-α-induced apoptosis and that inhibition of this pathway partially blocked the anti-apoptotic effect[1, 32]. Although different methods of mechanical stimulation were used, the results of these two studies are consistent with our observations. It is widely accepted that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway mediates the anti-apoptotic effect, but the roles of the three MAPK pathways in mechanical stress-induced apoptosis are still not clear. It was suggested that mechanical stress-induced apoptosis in chondrocytes was mediated by all three MAPK pathways, while another study reported that activation of ERK produced anti-apoptotic effects in cyclic stretch-induced annulus fibrosus cells apoptosis[10, 14]. Our results indicated that p38 and ERK were not involved in osteoblast apoptosis induced by mechanical stress, in contrast to these two reports. These discrepancies may be related to differences in the cell types cultured and methods of mechanical stimulation. Further research will be required to determine the precise molecular mechanism.The caspase family pathway is considered to be of great importance in apoptosis, as many apoptotic signaling pathways ultimately activate caspase cascades[16]. Activated caspases initiate protein degradation and are responsible for cell apoptosis[37]. Of the many signaling pathways to activate the caspase family, the Bcl-2 family plays an important role in many cell types. Bcl family proteins can be divided into anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w and Mcl-1) and pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bad, Bak, Bik and Bid)[17]. Bax promotes apoptosis by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and downstream activation of caspases, while Bcl-2 inhibits cell apoptosis by restraining the pro-apoptotic effects of Bax and blocking the release of cytochrome c[38, 39]. Therefore, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio is important for controlling cell apoptosis by regulating activation of effective cleaved caspases. Phosphorylated Bad inhibits cell apoptosis by dissociating Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL from Bcl-XL-Bad and Bcl-2-Bad heterodimers, respectively, which leads to a decreased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio[40]. We found that large-magnitude mechanical stress resulted in increased expression of Bax protein and decreased expression of p-Bad and Bcl-2. Caspase-3 is considered to be a central mediator of apoptosis and is one of the major activated cysteine proteases in the caspase family that is pivotal in apoptosis[41]. It was reported that cyclic stretch-induced apoptosis was controlled by caspase-3[42]. Considering its importance in apoptosis, we observed cleaved caspase-3 protein levels in the current study, indicating an association with increased apoptosis in osteoblasts responding to large-magnitude mechanical stress. Our results thus indicate that large-magnitude mechanical stress may induce cell apoptosis by the Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3 pathway. By using specific inhibitors, we found that inactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway partially blocked the anti-apoptotic effect in osteoblasts by down-regulating p-Bad, which resulted in an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and activation of caspase-3. However, the JNK pathway exerted a pro-apoptotic effect by directly increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and not by altering levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad. Since the interaction of these intracellular signaling pathways form a complex network, we also examined the effect of inhibiting one signaling pathway on the other. Our results showed that phosphorylation of JNK and Akt by mechanical stress were independent.The present study demonstrates that mechanical stress induces apoptosis in osteoblasts by activating the JNK pathway and inhibiting the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. As activation of JNK leads to apoptosis, while Akt protects against it, we propose that the regulation of mechanical stress on osteoblast apoptosis is controlled by a balance of effects (Fig 8). Mechanical stimulation can induce phosphorylation of JNK and Akt simultaneously, but the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is significantly activated only under small-magnitude mechanical stress to produce an anti-apoptotic effect. As the mechanical load increases, phosphorylation of JNK increases and phosphorylation of Akt is decreased, thus inducing an apoptotic effect. However, we did not investigate the mechanisms underlying the different levels of JNK and PI3K/Akt activation produced by varying levels of mechanical stress or other signaling pathways involved in the apoptotic effect. Although our understanding of mechanical stress-mediated apoptotic effects in osteoblasts remains poor and requires further investigation, our findings do provide a new model to simulate the stress environment of osteoblasts and offer as a complementing for the mechanisms in the regulation of mechanical stress-mediated apoptosis in osteoblasts.In summary, the above results increase our understanding of the mechanisms associated with osteoblast apoptosis in response to mechanical forces, which is partly mediated through JNK MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathway regulation of Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3 activation, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis upon small-magnitude stress and increased apoptosis upon large-magnitude stress. Further work will be necessary to investigate the precise molecular mechanisms regulating osteoblast apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation in response to mechanical stress.AcknowledgmentsFanglong Song and Yi Wang designed the experiments; Fanglong Song, Dawei Jang and Yi Wang performed experiments; Tianchen Wang, Yinquan Zhang and Hui Ma analyzed the data; Yi Wang prepared figures; Fanglong Song drafted the manuscript; Yifan Kang conceived the study, supervised all the experiments and revised this manuscript.Author ContributionsConceptualization: FS YK.Formal analysis: TW YZ HM.Methodology: FS YW.Resources: FS DJ YW.Software: YW.Supervision: YK.Visualization: YW.Writing – original draft: FS.Writing – review & editing: YK.References1.

Each tree represents certain evolutionary information of the species (denoted as cluster, will be discussed in the following) [1–4]. When rooted phylogenetic trees are constructed by different methods or from different datasets, all of the evolutionary information represented by these tree are often conflicting. The conflicting evolutionary information cannot be expressed as a phylogenetic tree. However, phylogenetic network can represent the conflicting evolutionary information, which is a generalization of phylogenetic tree. It can also describe the evolution involving significant amounts of reticulate events such as recombinations, hybridizations, and horizontal gene transfers [5–9].Phylogenetic networks can be divided into unrooted [10–15] and rooted networks [16–26]. Unrooted phylogenetic networks are mainly used to visualize conflicting evolutionary information. Rooted phylogenetic networks not only can represent conflicting evolutionary information implied phylogenetic trees, but also can describe the reticulate evolutionary events that species occurred during evolution [27]. There is a large body of research on rooted phylogenetic networks. Devising appropriate algorithms for constructing rooted phylogenetic networks from rooted phylogenetic trees has become an important field of research in molecular evolution. Recently a lot of scholars have focused on the research of the field, and developed a number of methods.Dendroscope [28] is a program for constructing rooted phylogenetic networks, which unites some methods such as the cluster network [29], the galled network [30] and the CASS [22]. Among all of the methods, the CASS can construct simpler networks than other methods, but it is extremely slow for large datasets. And the networks constructed by the CASS are highly dependent on the order of input data, i.e. the constructed phylogenetic networks are generally different for the same dataset when input orders are different. Then Wang et al improved the CASS algorithm, and designed two algorithms: the LNETWORK [31] and the BIMLR [32]. The LNETWORK and the BIMLR are faster than CASS and have less influence of input data order.In the following, we refer to rooted phylogenetic networks as networks, unless otherwise stated.PreliminariesGiven a set of taxa . A subset of  (except both ∅ and ) is called a cluster. For two clusters C1 and C2 on , if they are disjoint or one is a subset of the other, i.e. C1 ∩ C2 = ∅ or C1 ⊆ C2 or C2 ⊆ C1, we say that C1 and C2 are compatible, otherwise they are incompatible. Given a set of clusters  on . If any two clusters in  is compatible,  is called compatible, otherwise it is incompatible. The incompatibility graph IG() = (V, E) of  is defined as an undirected graph with node set V = C and edge set E, where two clusters are connected by an edge if and only if they are incompatible.Let S be a subset of . The restriction of  to S, denoted by , is defined as the result of removing all of the taxa in  (i.e. the taxa in  but not in S) from each cluster in . The incompatibility degree of , denoted by , is defined as the number of edges in . Let  be a set of clusters on  and x a taxon in . The incompatibility degree of x, denoted by d(x), is defined as the result of subtracting the incompatibility degree of  from that of , i.e. . If the incompatibility degree of a taxon x is maximal among all of the taxa in , i.e. , we call that x is the incompatibility taxon w.r.t. . The frequency of a taxon x w.r.t. , denoted by f(x), is defined as the number of clusters which contain x, i.e. .A rooted phylogenetic network N = (V, E) on  is a rooted directed acyclic graph (DAG for short), and its leaves are bijectively labelled as . The indegree of a node v ∈ V is denoted as σ(v). A node v is a reticulate node if σ(v) ≥ 2; otherwise it is a tree node; particularly, a tree node is a root node if σ(v) = 0. An edge e = (u, v) is a tree edge if v is a tree node, otherwise it is a reticulate edge. The reticulation number in a network N = (V, E) is ∑σ(v)>0(σ(v) − 1) = |E| − |V| + 1.Given a cluster C and a rooted phylogenetic tree T. If there is an edge e in T such that the set of taxa reachable from e equals C, we say that T represents C. Given a network N, when connecting one incoming edge and disconnecting all other incoming edges for each reticulate node, if there exists a tree edge e such that the set of taxa reachable from e equals C, we say that N represents C in the softwired sense. Alternatively, if there is a tree edge e in N such that the set of taxa reachable from e equals C, we say that N represents C in the hardwired sense.Let N = (V, E) be a network representing the set of clusters . A cluster  is often represented by more than one tree edge in N and a tree edge e ∈ E often represents more than one cluster in . If there exists a mapping ϵ from  to the set of tree edges of N, where ϵ(C) is a tree edge representing C for , such that for any two clusters , C1 and C2 lie in the same connected component of the incompatibility graph IG() if and only if ϵ(C1) and ϵ(C2) are contained in the same biconnected component of N. Then we call that N is decomposable w.r.t. .When constructing rooted phylogenetic networks from rooted phylogenetic trees, the methods first compute the clusters represented by the input trees, and then construct a rooted phylogenetic network representing all clusters.The rooted phylogenetic networks can describe evolutionary history in the presence of reticulate events, such as horizontal gene transfers, hybridizations and recombinations. These reticulate events are rare in reality [33]. Accordingly, it is expected that the constructed network has the minimal number of reticulate nodes. Let N be a network constructed for the input cluster set . Assume that  is the set of clusters represented by N. In fact  contains more clusters than , i.e. . Here we define the redundant clusters  of N as the clusters which are in  but not in , i.e. . In phylogenetic analysis, the taxa in a cluster are putative monophyletic. Consequently, the ideal situation would be , i.e. all clusters represented by the constructed network would be the clusters represented in the input trees, and no others. Therefore, by means of parsimony principle, the best constructed network is one that minimizes the number of redundant clusters, which is based on the prerequisite that it has minimal number of reticulate nodes.The following section will introduce the main methods for constructing rooted phylogenetic networks from rooted phylogenetic trees.MethodsSo far, the main methods for constructing rooted phylogenetic networks from rooted phylogenetic trees are the cluster network, the galled network, the CASS, the LNETWORK and the BIMLR. The following will give a brief introduction to each method.The cluster network is a method for constructing rooted phylogenetic networks, which is based on the Hasse diagram. Given a set of clusters . It first defines a partial order which is a binary relation ≼ on : for , u ≼ v if and only if u ⊆ v. The  is called a partially ordered set. Then it draws a Hasse diagram H = (V, E) for , which is a DAG with node set  and the edge set E, where there is an edge e = (u, v) if and only if  and there exists no other node w in V such that . Finally it labels the leaves of H by the taxa of  and assigns the root of H. The result DAG is the rooted phylogenetic network representing .The galled network is a method based on the seed-growing algorithm. It first finds a set of taxa  by seed-growing algorithm such that the set  is compatible. Next it constructs a rooted tree T for . Finally it attaches the reticulate nodes to T under a certain amount of constraints, where the labels of nodes which are children of reticulate nodes are the taxa of S. The constructed network represents .The CASS, the LNETWORK and the BIMLR are the methods based on the decomposition property of networks. They first find all non-trivial biconnected components  of ; and then construct the subnetwork for ; next integrate those subnetworks into a final network. The difference among them is the construction of the subnetworks.We have known that a network N represents an incompatible set of clusters. After removing all reticulate nodes from N, N becomes a tree representing a compatible set of clusters. However, the construction of networks is the inverse process mentioned above. Given a set of clusters  on . We can construct a tree for  if it is compatible, otherwise, we first remove some taxa from , such that the result set  is compatible, then construct a tree for , finally append the removed taxa to the tree under certain conditions.The CASS, the LNETWORK and the BIMLR construct subnetworks by the above description. Assume that the taxa set of  is  (1 ≤ i ≤ k). When constructing the subnetworks for , they first remove a few taxa of  from each cluster in , such that the result set  is compatible, then construct a rooted tree T for , next attach some new reticulate nodes to T, finally add a new leaf below each reticulate node and label it as the removed taxon. From the process, we can see that the removed taxa in  are very pivotal.The difference among the CASS, the LNETWORK and the BIMLR is the removed taxa. The CASS tries to remove a few taxa, i.e. by means of trial and error, it randomly removes some taxa, if it can construct a network representing the set of clusters, then it stops; otherwise it continues to remove other taxa. The LNETWORK removes the taxa computed by seed-growing algorithm. The BIMLR removes the incompatibility taxa with the maximal frequency. The CASS method aims at minimizing the number of reticulate nodes, while the LNETWORK and the BIMLR not only minimize the number of redundant of clusters but also let the reticulate nodes as few as possible.When constructing networks, the LNETWORK and the BIMLR find all networks representing the cluster set, mainly to reduce the number of redundant clusters in the resulting network and lessen the influence of the input data order on the resulting network.ResultsIn order to survey the performance of those methods, we do the experiments using both the practical and artificial data. The paper [31] has compared the LNETWORK, the CASS, the cluster network and the galled network; and the results show that the LNETWORK and the CASS can construct much simpler networks than the others. Here we just compare the LNETWORK, the CASS and the BIMLR using both the practical and artificial data (https://sites.google.com/site/cassalgorithm/data-sets).All experiments were performed on a computer with an Intel Xeon E5504 2.0GHz CPU, 8 GB RAM and 147GB HDD. The operating system was Debian 4.1 32bit with Java 1.6 installed.The experiments are used to compare two main aspects of these methods, on the one hand, the influence of input data order (Table 1 shows the results), on the other hand, the complexities of the constructed network, i.e. the reticulation number and the number of redundant clusters (Tables 2 and 3 show the results).

Results of BIMLR, LNETWORK and CASS for the practical datasets.              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165834.t003The papers [31, 32] have shown that the LNETWORK and the BIMLR are superior to the CASS in terms of the influence of input data order; and the two methods are faster than the CASS. Here we just compare the LNETWORK and the BIMLR on the influence of input data order, and the results are shown in Table 1. In the experiment, because each program needs to construct the network for every input order of dataset, the running time is factorial. Accordingly, here we just use the dataset with small scale. When comparing networks constructed by a method for the same dataset with different input orders, the difference of those networks is more small, the method is more stable, otherwise it is unstable. Here the difference among the constructed networks is measured by means of the tripartition distances [34].Table 1 shows the number of constructed networks, the mean, the minimum (min) and the maximum (max) of tripartition distance of those networks constructed for each dataset. And the last row shows the average values. From the Table 1 we come to the following conclusions. First, for the same data with different input orders, the number of different networks constructed by the BIMLR is less than the number of different networks constructed by the LNETWORK except for the dataset with  and . Second, for almost datasets, the mean, min, max of the BIMLR are less than corresponding values of the LNETWORK except for the datasets with ,  and . The result shows that, when the input order of the data is changed, even the network constructed by the BIMLR is more than one, those networks are more similar to each other than the networks constructed by LNETWORK. Thus, the BIMLR are more stable than the LNETWORK.We compare the BIMLR, the LNETWORK and the CASS on several artificial datasets. Table 2 shows the results, which have the reticulation number r, the redundant cluster number c, the running time t in hours (h), minutes (m) and seconds (s), and their average values in last row. Table 2 shows that the BIMLR takes least time except for the datasets with  and . For every dataset, the reticulation number of the network constructed by the BIMLR is the same as that of the network constructed by CASS, which is less than that of the network constructed by the LNETWORK. The networks constructed by LNETWORK have fewer redundant clusters than the networks constructed by CASS for almost all datasets, while the networks constructed by BIMLR have fewest redundant clusters. Thus, the networks constructed by BIMLR are simplest in terms of the redundant clusters and the reticulation number contained in the constructed networks for the artificial datasets.We compare the BIMLR, the LNETWORK and the CASS on practical datasets. Table 3 shows the results, which have the reticulation number r, the redundant cluster number c, the running time t in hours (h), minutes (m) and seconds (s) and their average values in last row. Table 3 shows the BIMLR takes least time except for the dataset with . For most datasets, the reticulation number of the networks constructed by the CASS is least, secondly LNETWORK, at least BIMLR. The networks constructed by LNETWORK have fewest redundant clusters, secondly the BIMLR, at least CASS. Table 3 shows that the average reticulation number of LNETWORK and BIMLR is slightly more than that of CASS. Hence, the networks constructed by LNETWORK are simplest for the practical dataset.From the Tables 2 and 3, it follows that the LNETWORK and the BIMLR take less time than the CASS; the networks constructed by LNETWORK and BIMLR have fewer redundant clusters than those constructed by CASS; and the average reticulation number of LNETWORK and BIMLR are slightly more than that of CASS.ConclusionWe compared BIMLR, LNETWORK and CASS using one artificial and one practical dataset. The results show that the BIMLR is superior to the others for the artificial datasets, while the LNETWORK is superior to the others for the practical datsets. Accordingly in practice, the LNETWORK is the best option for the construction of networks.AcknowledgmentsI would like to thank the editor and two anonymous referees for remarks and suggestions which improved the exposition in this paper.Author ContributionsConceptualization: JW.Data curation: JW.Formal analysis: JW.Funding acquisition: JW.Investigation: JW.Methodology: JW.Project administration: JW.Resources: JW.Software: JW.Supervision: JW.Validation: JW.Visualization: JW.Writing – original draft: JW.Writing – review & editing: JW.References1.
